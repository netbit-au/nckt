  /* Purpose: Print error message (currently only to stdout) approximately in GNU style, i.e., "program_name: ERROR error message....\n". 
     Routine is intended to make error messages convenient to use in routines without routine itself needing access to copy of program. 
     Therefore a copy of this routine should be placed in each main.c file, just like the program's nco_usg_prn() routine. */

  /* Routine is more difficult to implement practically than it first seemed, because 
     it assumes all calling routines have their error messages in a single string, when
     in reality, they often utilize var_args capabilities of fprintf() themselves and
     have multiple formatted inputs. Hold off for now. */
