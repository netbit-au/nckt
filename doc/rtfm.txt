Dear NCO user,

This form letter response is being sent for one or more of the
following reasons. Please read it, decide which apply, and respond
accordingly:

1. You have mailed me a question or a bug report rather than posted it to

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nco 

NCO is administered at this location.
By posting your question/bug here you will simplify life for me, and
make it possible for others to learn from your experience.
Anonymous postings are accepted, but you can also decide register,
and thus receive automatic notices when your questions are responded
to, by visiting http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php
SourceForge is not commercial--they are not trying to sell you anything.
To get a response to your NCO question, post to the NCO Help Forum at

http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=9830

or post your bug report to the NCO bug tracker at

http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=3331

2. You have mailed me a question which shows that you are probably
using an older version of NCO. Read the News and ChangeLog section on
the homepage http://nco.sourceforge.net and you will find the feature
you need exists in the latest version of NCO. Announcements of new
versions and features are made on the very low volume mailing list
nco-announce, which you can register for at

http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/nco-announce

3. You have not read and understood the manual. After reading the
manual you should post your question to the Help Forum listed above.
The most answerable questions are accompanied with the exact commands
which are problematic, NCO version information, and file metadata.  

Thanks,
Charlie
