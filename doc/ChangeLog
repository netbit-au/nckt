	* NCO 4.0.2 release procedure:
 	Changes since nco-4_0_1: namespace, ncatted NUL, ncap2 1-d arrays
	cd ~/nco;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_2;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_2-1
	cd ~/nco;cvs commit -m "Preparing nco-4.0.2 release"
	cvs tag -c nco-4_0_2;cvs tag -c nco-4_0_2-1

2010-06-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix ncap2 to correctly cast variables with single dimension of size one
	Formerly, ncap2 wrote these as scalars in certain situations
	Thanks to Hugo for pointing this out and to Henry Butowsky for fixing it

2010-06-21  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Fixed bug with casting  a variable of size one. 
	This NOW works 'defdim("one",1);irmax[$one]=20L;'

2010-05-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Mark Hadfield reports that my Cygwin ncap2 build works fine
	His machines have working java setup, mine do not
	Either way, all NCO-caused issues with Cygwin have been resolved

2010-05-20  givre zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Makefile fixes for netCDF4 on AIX (bluefire)

2010-05-19  givre zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix Makefile.old for libnco_c++.a build on Cygwin

2010-05-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Upgrading to Kubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx failed, so spent day to
	get NCO running on Cygwin 1.7.5-1 under Vista. Everything was supplied by
	Cygwin:	GSL, or compiled fine from source: netCDF4/HDF5 and Antlr
	(actually antlr-2.7.7 needs #include <cstring> patch to CharScanner.hpp).
	So NCO with DAP, UDUnits2, netCDF4, ncap2 built fine! Amazing. 
	Only problem is executing ncap2, which cannot find java.

2010-05-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Generate autoconf/libtool sources with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx stack

2010-04-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean-up nco_aux.[ch] to work better with WRF files

2010-04-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merge Francesco Paolo Lovergine's downstream Debian changes

2010-04-27  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Added to manual chapter on GSL Random Number generation

2010-04-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix off-by-one error in ncatted appends for type NC_CHAR (TODO nco985)
	Extra NULs are no longer inserted with each append
	Thanks to A.T. Wittenburg for this bug report

	* Clean-up ncatted to address NUL-append problem

2010-04-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Namespace patches seem to work with bld/Makefile and with configure.

	* Apply patches from Denis Nadeau to prevent namespace clashes
	between NCO symbols generated by Flex/Bison, and those symbols
	generated by other programs (MPI, netCDF) that also use
	Flex/Bison. 

2010-04-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Oops! VERSION file released with 4.0.1 may say version is 4.0.0?

	* NCO 4.0.1 release procedure:
	Changes since nco-4_0_0: fix_rec_dmn, mk_rec_dmn, .ncrename
	cd ~/nco;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_1;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_1-1
	cd ~/nco;cvs commit -m "Preparing nco-4.0.1 release"

2010-04-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change Debian to libnetcdf4 with libnetcdf-dev (>= 1:4.0.0) in control

2010-03-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cleanup and document '--mk_rec_dmn' switch

2010-03-22  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Add '--mk_rec_dmn' switch to ncks: 
	Allows user to (re-)define the record dimension. If the redefined
	record dimension is not the first dimension of a given variable,
	then ncks fails with an error message.

2010-03-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove consti-fication of return values in global functions

2010-03-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Comment-out "\input texinfo" from my-bib-macros.texi to prevent
	that string from appearing in printed output. 
	
2010-03-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix ncrename.c to not die after skipping non-existent targets
	(variables/dimensions/attributes) preceded by '.'. Longstanding bug!

	* Supercede NO_REC_DMN with FIX_REC_DMN

	* Various cleanups of ncoGrammer.g, nco_mss_val.c, ncks.c, nco_var_utl.c

2010-03-11  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Add '--no_rec_dmn' switch to ncks: causes record dimension in
	input to be converted to a regular dimension in output.

2010-03-01  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Added to manual chapter on Re-basing Time Coordinate

2010-02-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cleanup nco_lmt.c

2010-02-16  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Add ncrcat tests for modifications below
	
2010-02-15  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Hyperslab limits of type lmt_crd_val/lmt_udu_sng with 
	stride > 1 now work with multifile operators, e.g.,
	ncrcat -v time -d time,3.0,30.0,8 t1.nc t2.nc out.nc

2010-02-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tidy-up value_list action in tree parser.
	  Added value_list_string for NC_STRING

	* Added ncap_typ_hgh() to libnco

2010-01-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* As of 20091030 NCO_TYP_INT defaults to int rather than long
	Following changes bring nomenclature into alignment with this

	* Change NC_INT variable names from *_lng to *_ntg

	* Change ptr_typ union for NC_INT from lp to ip

	* Change val_typ union for NC_INT from l to i

	* Remove nco_gmm.[ch] to avoid Burkardt copyright
	Gamma functions now supplied by GSL.

	* Replace " != NULL" and " != NULL_CEWI" with ""
	This is just code cleanup which is always valid
	When pointer values are evaluated as boolean conditions, it is
	identical to comparing the pointer to NULL.
	Hence code now has, e.g., if(cmd_ln) ... instead of if(cmd_ln != NULL)
	Could/should also replace "foo == NULL" with !foo?
	
2010-01-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Workaround ncoGrammer.g dependence on NC_MAX_INT which DNE 
	in netcdf.h until ~2009

2010-01-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Patch configure.in for broken GSL installations like bluefire's, 
	where GSL exists though gsl-config does not

	* Only attempt duplicating netCDF4 settings when output is netCDF4
	Do not rely on no-ops from netCDF3 and netCDF4-classic files

2010-01-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Patch --enable-netcdf-4 implementation

2010-01-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* NCO 4.0.0 release procedure:
	Changes since nco-3_9_9: bilinear, fitting, chunking
	cd ~/nco;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_0;cvs tag -d nco-4_0_0-1
	cd ~/nco;cvs commit -m "Preparing nco-4.0.0 release"
	cvs tag -c nco-4_0_0;cvs tag -c nco-4_0_0-1

	* Change HAVE_NEW_CHUNKING_API to NC_HAVE_NEW_CHUNKING_API to
	leverage information now in netcdf.h about correct API.
	Required for successful .deb builds with netCDF3.

2009-12-10  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Added initialization to NULL of chunk sizes prs_arg.cnk_sz in
	ncap2.cc. This was causing a bug on CentOS builds.

2009-11-20  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Added to manual chapter on bilinear_interp_wrap()

2009-11-16  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Tidy ups in main() ncpdq/ncecat/ncflint/ncra/ncbo

2009-11-09  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Modify 'dsort(var,&var_mp)'
	if output file is netcdf4 then the created map is of type NC_UINT64 
	else it is of type NC_INT

	* Refactor all gsl_stats code -hnd_fnc_stat? So that
	the 'size_t n' argument is user input to functions

2009-11-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify nco_is_spc_in_crd_att() implementation on NARCCAP file

	* Add nco_is_spc_in_crd_att() to test whether variable is
	specified in "coordinates" attribute

	* Change sprintf() and scanf() formatting for nco_int from long to int

	* Implement empirical list of N-D coordinate "fixed" variables:
	lat, lon, lev, longxy, latixy

	* Change fixed variable exclusion condition from is_ncbo to
	is_rnk_prs_rth_opr()

2009-10-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* #define NCO_INT NCO_TYP_INT instead of NCO_TYP_LONG
	Longs are 8-bytes on 64-bit systems, and NCO_INTs are always 4 bytes.
	Stuffing the 4 bytes into 8 bytes of RAM is harmless locally, and
	ensures the NCO code is robust in other ways. 
	However, it also seems to confuse/break DAP-handling of ints.
	
2009-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add short option -6, and better document -6, --64, --64bit options

2009-10-21  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Ensure ncap2 compiles	with NCO_INT==NCO_TYP_INT. Affects
	fmc_all_cls.cc msk_cls srt_cls fmc_gsl_cls.cc, map_srt_tmp.hh,
	ncoGrammar.g   
	
2009-10-15  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Tidy-up sort methods srt_cls

2009-10-13  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Add secret flag tst_udunits option to ncks. 
	Usage: --tst_udunits,'units_in','units_out','calendar type'
        
2009-09-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove attempt to set chunking in ncap2 writes

2009-09-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

2009-09-11  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com> 

	* Committed first cut of nco_cal.{c,h}

	* These are calendar functions for hyperslabbing coordinate
	variables with CF attribute "calendar". Currently supported
	are "360_day","no_leap","365_day". Other values for date
	evaluation default to "standard", the  	UDUnits1/2 calendar
	functionality. NB: regardless of the chosen calendar type all date
	strings are parsed by UDUnits1/2 
	
2009-08-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add spiral logo by Andrea Cimatoribus to bakeoff

2009-08-26  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@hush.com>

	* Only fill in shuffle, deflate, dfl_lvl when pointers are
	non-NULL in netCDF3 nco_inq_var_deflate()

	* Add nco_inq_var_fletcher32()

	* Add first cut of bil_cls - functions for bilinear interpolation
	of gridded 2D data

2009-07-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replace ellipsis ("\.\.\.") to better ROFF ellipsis ("\ .\|.\|.\ ")
	Found this hack by examining /usr/share/man/man1/nroff.1.gz

	* Convert ROFF hyphens ("-") to ROFF minuses ("\-")

	* Examined Debian build logs and cleaned up minor problems

	* Correct ROFF hypens to minuses, and format ellipsis in man pages

	* NCO is once again C++-compliant, compiles/runs/tests fine with g++

	* Explicitly set ddra_info.flg_ddra=False in g++-compiled code
	since C++ does not allow structure-member initialization

	* Satisfy C++ by explicitly casting (void *) to (lmt_sct *) and to
	(char *) (rather than relying on implicit conversion)

2009-07-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Thank all packagers in nco.texi

	* Barry deFreese uploaded 3.9.9 to Debian Sid. Hallelujah!

	* NCO 3.9.9 release procedure:
	Changes since nco-3_9_8: chunking, NC_STRING, GSL stats/interp, rebasing
	cd ~/nco;cvs tag -d nco-3_9_9;cvs tag -d nco-3_9_9-1
	cd ~/nco;cvs commit -m "Preparing nco-3.9.9 release"
	cvs tag -c nco-3_9_9;cvs tag -c nco-3_9_9-1

	* Cleaned up and annotated copyright history in copyright file

	* Fix configure.in bug in HAVE_NETCDF4_H test

2009-07-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* 20090712: For unknown reason autobuild sees netCDF4 netcdf.h
	header when it should not. Moreover, autobuild thinks 
	"const nco_string *sng" conflicts with "const char **sng" 
	in all nc_put_var?_string() and nc_put_att_string() functions. 
	Even though nco_string = char * = should be synonymous
	Implement kludge workaround to latter until former is solved

	* Fix prototype error for NCO_GET_VAR[1ASM]_USHORT, NCO_GET_ATT_USHORT
	Buffer had erroneously been set to nco_ubyte in these functions

	* Introduce HAVE_NETCDF4_H to indicated presence of netCDF4
	headers but not necessarily netCDF4 libraries.
	Use HAVE_NETCDF4_H instead of ENABLE_NETCDF4 in some checks
	ENABLE_NETCDF4 now refers to presence of netCDF4-enabled library
	Thus ENABLE_NETCDF4 implies HAVE_NETCDF4_H
	The converse is not true

	* Clean-up, de-space NCO_rgr.pm

2009-07-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add Rich Signell's "cog" logos to homepage and doc directory

	* Chunking works: plc=all for map=rd1,dmn
	Chunking fails  : plc=g?d for map=rd1,dmn
	Chunking fails  : plc=uck

	* Allow cnk_map=dmn to work with record hyperslabs, e.g.,
	ncks -O -4 -D 4 --cnk_map=dmn -d time,0,3 ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc

	* Improve chunking corner-case logic

	* Restore precedence of explicitly specified chunking for record
	dimension over that implicitly specified by chunking map rd1
	
	* Discriminate between BASIC_DMN and non BASIC_DMN

	* Fix chunking to look at dmn_sz_org for record variables

	been fixed (by updating to snapshot netCDF4) as of 20090504.
	One remaining problem is that NCO silently succeeds on overflows.
	Should it?

	* Improve logic/warnings/info for DAP-wget fall-throughs

2009-05-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Some chunking parameters work, some cause "Bad chunk sizes" errors

	  Changes since nco-3_9_2: SWAMP, ncecat -u, wget, ncap2 OpenMP, GCC 4.2
	
	* Update documentation for SWAMP, AGU, and IJHPCA

2007-11-29  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	* Remove leading slash from derived local path for HTTP_URL retrievals

2007-09-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* wget retrieval works iff -l used, regardless of -p use

	* More exhaustive debugging and local file searches prior to wget attempt

	* Implement nco_close() to pair with nco_open() in DAP probe.
	  Not doing this previously probably means that NCO via DAP

	* Add ncap2_tst.nco, Henry's ncap2 test script, to distribution

2007-07-18  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	* Turned prs_sct into class. It has four methods:
	contructor, ncap_var_init(), ncap_var_write(), ncap_def_ntl_scn() 

2007-07-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add failsafe NC_FORMAT_CLASSIC definition so tst.cc builds with
	OPeNDAP netcdf.h, which lacks pre-netCDF 3.6.1 tokens

	* Polish deflate functionality and documentation

2007-06-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Describe deflation in nco.texi

2007-06-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco.spec patch by Daniel to always put netcdf-3 on path and, for
	x86_64, add -L/usr/lib64, when present, to correctly resolve
	32/64-bit libraries  

	* Define some netCDF tokens for really old versions of libnetcdf.a
	still in use on enterprise distributions like RHEL/CentOS.
	These tokens need are defined both in nco.h and nco_netcdf.c to 
	enforce code firewall to keep netCDF wrappers separate from NCO.

2007-06-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Commited the first cut of while loops and for loops
	Can use "break" & "continue" in both. Can have any level of nesting.
	These are vanilla unoptimized loops. Optimization to come!!	 

2007-06-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add [put/get]_string functions now in netcdf4 daily snapshots
        In particular, synchronize with snapshot2007060701
	
2007-06-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove stdint.h from xlC and SGI builds of ncap2
	stdint.h "helps" g++ builds (by defining [U]LLONG_MAX)

2007-06-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Switch to daily snapshot 20070603 for development

2007-06-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Unable to get compression working. Generates HDF5 errors.

	* Implement --dfl_lvl to set HDF Lempel-Ziv deflation level
	Always turn shuffle on, since it is inexpensive and improves compression
	
	* Allow user-specified down-conversion of netCDF4->netCDF3

	* Include stdint.h where "long long" types are used
	This should fix build problems with icpc

	* Add nco_var_def_deflate() and stub to libnco

2007-05-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix typos spotted by donor Kevin Raeder

2007-05-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Include NC_UBYTE and NC_STRING as funky variable types in var_lst_dvd()

	* Add better ncdiff regression for packed subtraction

	* Change put_var(var_prc_out[idx]->type) to var_prc_out[idx]->typ_upk
	in arithmetic operators to output inflated variables to disk.
	This should fix TODO nco862, a regression introduced sometime 
	between 2.7.1 and 3.2.0 and noticed by Remik Ziemlinski.

	* Postpone 3.9.0 release until ncdiff/packing bug TODO nco862 is fixed

2007-05-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add nco_inq_format() compatibility stubs for pre-netCDF3.6.1 libraries

	* Decided to release as 3.9.0 rather than 3.2.1

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_2_1_beta2
	Changes since last tag:
	NCO builds and tests fine from both netCDF3 and netCDF4!
	Candidate is releasable. ncap2 NC_UBYTE problem is not solved.

	* Testing with ~/c++/ccc.cc shows that NC_UBYTE support is non-trivial 
	No need to hold up release to finish this

	* antlr 2.7.6 fails on mpc64.nacs.uci.edu with pgCC
	This does not seem to be an NCO problem

	* Added sng2nbr() from ~/c++/utl.hh to sdo_utl.hh

2007-05-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* AIX xlC has ncap2 build problem: "std::strtoll" is not declared.

	* Cast all naked nc_type tokens being thrown around in ncap2 code
	In addition to being bad programming style, these naked tokens 
	trigger the netCDF3/netCDF4 nc_type incompatibility bug.
	The bug is that the nc_type NC_TYPE tokens are enumerated (enums)
	in netCDF3 and are simple pre-processor tokens in netCDF4.

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_2_1_beta1
	Changes since last tag:
	netCDF3 build works again and tests fine. Huzzah.

	netCDF3 does not build because ncoGrammer.g lacks netcdf4 #ifdef's

	* Add netcdf4.nco test script for netCDF4-enabled ncap2

	* Add netCDF4 casting functions ushort(), int64(), etc. to ncap_lex.l

	* Verified ncap ll,LL,ull,ULL,us,ui, etc. parsing works

	* Finished netCDF4'ing ncap_lex.l, ncap_yacc.y, ncap_utl.c

2007-05-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified that ddra.nco works with int64 types so storing large
	counts as floats no longer necessary! 

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_2_1_alpha3
	Changes since last tag:
	After netCDF4'ing most files. 
	netCDF4 references in ncoGrammer.g break netCDF3 ncap2

	* Explain ncwa memory usage in nco.texi

2007-05-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Comment out unused variables. These caused noisy compiles.
	Retain some for future use in cases where they might help in
	debugging or where their presence enhances code symmetry or would
	be non-trivial to re-introduce. Mark such variables as CEWI
	RUVICFFU = Retain Unused Variables In Comments For Future Use

	* Re-format error messages to print error code if available, 
	and to always print msg, if any

	* Changed prototype and disambiguated ncap_sclr_var_mk()
	This allows g++ 4.1.2 to compile ncap2 again.

	* Remove OpenMP and thr_nbr references from ncrename.c

	* Fix regressions stemming from passing --fl_fmt to ncatted

	* Put ${NETCDF_INC} before ${ANTLR_INC} in CPPFLAGS in nco++ Makefile

	ncap2 behavior 

2007-03-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement all GCC custom switches in nco++, nco_c++ directories
	nco directory and configure.in have all cust switches except -Werror
	-Werror still triggers problems with ncap_lex.c

	* Add wildcards to end of all compiler tests in configure.in
	so that, e.g., CC='gcc' tests same as CC='gcc -std=c99'

2007-03-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix ncap2 comparison between signed/unsigned integer expression warnings

	* Fold in Daniel's nco.spec change required for 64-bit builds on

	Changes since nco-3_1_8: nc[wre]a normalization, ncap2 qutoes
	variables, quieter output, RPMs support ncap2, ncecat does
	per-file hyperslab expansion

	* NCO 3.1.8 RPM builds/installs/removes properly with FC6
	Resulting executables work fine on local files
	DAP access is enabled, but broken. Unsure why.

	* enable-optimize-custom and -Wall are close to working on ncap2
	Should be possible to get this working again by 3.2.0
	
	* Cryptographically sign RPMs with GPG during BFS

	Attempting to fix bug by creating named constant with global
	library visibility.

2006-05-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	Old code at nco.sf.net is a hodgepodge of erratic commits over past week.

	* Finished hand-merging one week's patches from development on
	multiple machines due to sourceforge.net outage. 
	Master code is now on ashes. Everything from about

	* spiffin' config/make to bypass nco++ politely if antlr not available
	also now forces regeneration of hpp files - 1st .cc file triggers
	rebuild.  Builds (or doesn't) on a clean checkout.

	* 'make install' installs ncap2 to bindir if it's built.

	* mod configure to skip nco++ if trying to build for MPI (nco++
	fails on the MPI build - a concern at this point?)

	* autoconf/automake patches to allow nco++ and MPI to co-exist and mods
	to allow MPI regressions and benchmarks to (mostly) work.

2006-03-15  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	* Fix NUMBER lexer. Can now lex number like 23. or 111. etc

	* Fix NcapVar.hh -- Code was crashing when var->nm was set equal to s_va_nm

	* Start code for slab indices added lmt_peek() & lmt_init() to ncoTree.hpp

2006-03-14  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* nco++ dir now works with autoconf/automake, altho only tested with
	simple cases (only gcc/g++ compilers, etc).  Original Makefile renamed
	to Makefile.old. Tested under --enable-nco++=yes (default) &
	--enable-nco++=no.  Added more logic as per CZ request on 3.15 - now
	checks for runantlr, libantlr, antlr headers, 

2006-03-13  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* all but 1 benchmark work server-side.  When trying to execute the ncrcat 
	bench, the serverside fails when doing the ncwa command.  It uses
	a very large amount of mem (~1.3G when it dies - de to an apache
	limitation?)  Daniel and I are giving up for now - marked as TODO 692.
	
	* failing regressions tested and some resolved to bad handling by
	benchmark script. Remaining ones are marked in the failure
	message. Only new one is TODO691 - looks like a problem with
	ncatted returning mysteriously null values. Total of 3 regressions
	failing - 2 ncap, 1 ncatted. 

2006-03-09  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* namespace cleanup on benchmark code and added rc capability to the code,
	first capability just records whether users said yes to send UDP data and
	then uses that answer to bypass the question from then on.
	Other info can be added in NAME=VALUE pairs and the detection routine
	reads them all into a global hash %NCO_RC that can be used to set various
	things.

2006-03-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added regression test to make sure nco686 stays fixed.

	* Re-work nco_mss_val_cnf() to handle all cases of var1 and var2
	having/not having missing values. Fixes TODO nco686.
	Probably fixed analogous latent bug in ncflint.

	* Remove bogus const prototype on return value of nco_typ_fmt_sng()
	Apparently gcc 4.0.3 actually pays attention to intended
	const-ness of return values in these situations 

	* Fix TODO nco687 so unequal missing values are formatted
	correctly in warning messages. This should help debug nco686.

2006-03-09  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* nco_bm_benchmarks.pl converted to NCO_benchmarks.pm with a good 
        bit of namespace cleanup.  There are still some inexplicable explicit
        declarations that are needed but only about 2-3.

	* both benchmark and regression code support both serverside and
	clientside execution.  There are still some remaining conflicts, 
	but most benchmarks and most regressions run identically.

	* the go() routine was rewritten to be a bit more coherent.  Again,
	there is a bit more cleanup to do, but it's time to get it into cvs

	* Daniel's ss code changes have tracked the benchmarking code, so both
	sides work with each other.  There are some unfortuneately primitive
	hacks to get them working together, but while it's ugly (perl writes 
	data to file and executes python to pick it up, it's simpler than
	bringing swig into the picture.

2006-02-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Hunt for double-free() in ncap, cleanup var_ycc-related operations

2006-02-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change more internal bool's to nco_bool's so g++ builds libnco.a (again)

2006-02-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Re-arrange packing/unpacking documentation to describe default
	handling by arithmetic operators.

2006-02-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add tst target to ncap2 Makefile

	* Verified regression test results unaltered

	* Change argument bool's to nco_bool's throughout libnco and frontends
	NB: I may have missed non-front-end bools in libnco.
	
	* ncap2 now compiles, links, and runs when libnco built with g++

	* Change ncap2 argument bool's to nco_bool's which are typedef's to int's

2006-02-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncap2 compiles, links, and fails when libnco built with gcc

	* ncap2 compiles, links, and runs when libnco built with g++

	* Change to int yywrap() from bool yywrap() to work with g++

	* Begin to clean up libnco++ usage/headers

	* Add libnco++.hh to store all libnco++ headers

	* Add ncap2 target to bld/Makefile for convenience

	* Re-make libnco (when necessary) before linking ncap2

	* Add ncap2 to prg_prs()

	* Add doc/ncap2.in to test ncap2

	* ncap2 builds within tree now!

	* Add udunits libraries, remove dat target

2006-02-16  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Corrected BM code to account for error strings being eval'ed as 0 
          when compared as numeric and a number of other error-checking
          improvements.

2006-02-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* This fixes TODOs nco672, nco673, nco402

	* Modify regression test to expect packed fixed data

	* Check is_var_fix flags in nco_var_dfn() to handle packed fixed data

	* Add is_var_fix to var_sct so nco_var_dfn() can use it to
	identify variables to pass through packed straight to output

2006-02-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Same problem exists with all other non-processed data. TODO nco673.

	* Add test whether non-record data is unpacked in ncra output file.
	ncra currently fails this test. Reported by Martin Dix.	TODO nco672.

2006-02-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Temporarily add ncap2 object files directly to link line

2006-02-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove redundant antlr actions. Add -lnco to LDFLAGS.

2006-02-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix nco++ library definition

2006-02-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move Henry's Makefile to Makefile.orig and Makefile.old to Makefile

	* nco++ build mechanism appears to work. Dies in VarOp.hh due to
	syntax error. Not understood yet.

2006-02-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Progress on build mechanism but nothing working

	* Avoid name clashes between nco++ and nco code by changing file
	names from ncap* to ncap2*

2006-01-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Created nco++/Makefile.old from nco_c++/Makefile.old
	  Made progress toward in-tree nco++ build

2006-01-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_1_1
	Changes since nco-3_1_0: 
	C++ builds work again, ssdap, nco++, 4.0-alpha11-compatible

	* Changed copyright to 2006

	* Daniel added server side extensions to ssdap

	* nco++ still has Henry's hardcoded paths---will fix in nco-3_1_1

	* Committed Henry's C++ ncap2 antlr-based code to nco++

2006-01-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified regular NCO builds with gcc-4.0.3 on dapper drake dirt

	* netcdf 4.0-alpha11 (still) fails regression tests as per TODO nco658

	* Make nco_lbr_vrs_prn() work with netcdf 4.0-alpha11-style values

	* Added integration example to ncwa in manual

2006-01-04  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>
	
 	* Fixes to the BM code to force the retrieval of DAP-requested files and
          a variable ($prsrv_fl) to allow a regression test to maintain files if 
	  a previously downloaded file is needed for a successive test.

	* noted in the TODO as well, but there is a difference between the
          opendap code running on sand (which passes all server-side
	  regression tests) and the code running on hiperstore, which
	  fails a number of them, many with OpenDAP errors emitted from
	  the lib.  Still figuring this out. 
	
	* mods to nco_fl_utl.c: in nco_fl_mk_lcl() to make ncatted and ncrename
	  fail gracefully when asked to DAP-retrieve a file on which to operate.

2005-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add xbitmap icon to homepage

2005-12-19  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>
	
	* mod bm code to make a new dir for dap data and explicitly delete 
	  everything in it for each new DAP test to force the network transfer.

2005-12-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Modify `make test` to automatically run regression test

	* Remove old nco_tst.pl references from Makefile.am `make test`

	* Fix yyunput argument type in ncap_lex.l

	* Reference prs_sct in yyerror to fix CEWI with g++ -Werror

2005-12-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* C++-compatibility tweaks to nco_lmt.c, nco_omp.c, and configure.in
	Current code causes g++ ICE TODO nco662
	
2005-12-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Strip -std=c99 from CC and CFLAGS if CC is gcc* in order to support
	to support using CC=g++ within configure. Ditto for
	-Wmissing-prototypes, and analogous procedures for xlC* and icpc*.

2005-12-08  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* fixed passive/active ftp problem exhibited on soot by making 'ftp'
        explicitly '/usr/bin/ftp' (it was a kerberos'ed ftp on soot for some
	reason - /usr/kerberos/bin/ftp).  For linux and esmf, the system ftp
	supports passive ftp (-p flag).  The kerberos ftp supports it as well
	but not as a flag which casued problems in the 'here' script.

2005-12-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Today's modifications allow G++ to build NCO limited by
	make non_ncap UDUNITS=N
	This NCO passes all regression tests
	ncap and UDUNITS linkage remain C++ problems and prevent closing TODO nco656
	
	* Hacked nco_malloc_*() to remove errno references with G++
	Presence triggers G++ error: undefined reference to `__errno_location()'
	This is TODO nco659
	
	* Set #define YYDEBUG 0 in ncap_yacc.y so C++ compiles ncap_yacc.c

	* Fix type conversions in nco_mss_val_cnf() 
	This fixed a latent bug that was probably never expressed

	* Explicitly coerce pointers in implicit conversions to make C++ happy in  
	nco_cmp_chr(), nco_cmp_int(), ncpdq.c 

	* Correct const-ness of string list arguments with prototypes in
	nco_prs_rnm_lst(), nco_fl_nm_prs()

	* Add doc/netcdf4.sh to install latest netcdf4 and HDF libraries for NCO

2005-12-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_1_0
	Changes since nco-3_0_3: 
	MPI ZKB, configure netcdf4/mpi, ncwa MRV, ncap rnd_nbr(), netcdf4-alpha10

	* Preparing for NCO 3.1.0 release

2005-11-30  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Changed ncap.c to allow MACOSX to use erf, erfc, gamma

	* changed configure.in to accept a more flexible OS/arch string to 
	be able to set AMD64 (reason for previous failing the erf() tests in
	ncap).
	
	* changed the ncap benchmark scripts to correct syntax errors and change 
	dimensions to correspond to the casting dimension order.

2005-11-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* bld/Makefile accepts FL_FMT for netCDF4 testing

2005-11-29  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Changed configure.in to use NETCDF4_ROOT rather than renaming to
	libnetcdf4.

2005-11-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove nco_open_par() again. Seems to require parallel mode
	in netCDF4 configure to appear in library, possible hardware dependency

2005-11-28  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>
	
	* Spiffing configure/makefiles to make sure that netcdf4 works as
	expected; adding dependencies into configure rather than requiring the
	full set to be run at the commandline.  Still a question about  the
	specification tho (--fl_fmt vs --netcdf4).

2005-11-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Test for averaging dimensions being MRV dimensions

2005-11-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change "long missing_value" to "nco_int missing_value"

2005-11-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Place operation count stanzas in expensive routines for paper:
	nco_var_cnf_dmn(), nco_var_avg()

2005-11-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Synchronize with netCDF4 alpha10, verified passes regression tests

	* Expose new types in attribute function calls

	* Change _int64/_uint64 to _longlong/_ulonglong in function names

	* Change NC_STRICT_NC3 to NC_CLASSIC_MODEL

2005-11-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added cheesy random number generator function rnd_nbr() to ncap
	ncap -O -v -s 'x=rnd_nbr(lat)' ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo.nc;ncks ~/foo.nc
	for generating fake data. Search source for TODO nco652 and improve!
	
2005-11-14  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* retired following TODOs
	bld68. hjm Verify configure with minimal options works with MACOSX
	bld53. hjm Add --fl_fmt option to nco_bm.pl (see ncks.c for fl_fmt values)
	bld62. hjm Make regressions fail when input file not created but
	       re-used from previous test etc
	bld71. hjm Mac OS X: remove false positive regressions in ncwa (cut?)
	bld72. hjm nco_bm: ensure "foo" (intermediate files) accessed locally
	       not over DAP
	bld46. Is DAP_ROOT (or DODS_ROOT) an obsolete variable in DAP 3.5+? if
	       so obsolete it

2005-11-14  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* corrected Benchmark code for opendap access.

2005-11-11  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* fixed net tests to test only returned value, not entire msg

	* Added UDP reporting query to regression and benchmark runs
	if users explicitly agree, to capture failures in regressiions
	automatically for better profiling.  Queries users if they will 
	allow data to be returned UNLESS the --udpreport is already set

	* Changes to Makefile.am in src/nco to enable MPI binaries to
	be built.

	* Notes about problems with old aclocal, automake posted
	have to assure that new versions are manually updated in *ubuntu
	anyway.

	* back on track with updating Makefiles the right way(c)

	* updated MANIFEST to include new bm scripts and the breakup of 
        nco_bm.pl.

2005-11-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Omit -lstdc++ from AIX xl* DAP builds

	* Add CVS Header and -*-makefile-*- to all Makefile.am's 
	This automatically invokes Emacs Makefile-mode syntax/highlighting

2005-10-31  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Changes to mk_bm_plots to scriptify the last of CZ's requests

	* Changes to configure/make to straighten out build protocols 
	for netcdf4 (NETCDF4_ROOT to be defined, needs to be named
	libnetcdf4, not libnetcdf).  Automatic paths for -I, -L based
	on the NETCDF4_ROOT) 
  
2005-10-28  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Changes to the configure/make chain to start to resolve
	autobuild issues with MPI / netcdf4 / DAP / etc

	* now builds serial NCOs cleanly on Linux (x86,AMD64)
	and also MPI on Linux (x86,AMD64).  Suports Rich Lowry's
	mpich2 debs (no additional flags) and MPICH2 from src if
	given MPICH_ROOT.
  
	* added checks for -lf95, more error checking

2005-10-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tried ncwa memory free()'ing technique to avoid freeing dangling
	pointers in mpncra/mpncea. Does not fix hanging processes.

2005-10-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More unused prototyping of MPI-IO access code.
	Implementing calls in mpncecat.c for testing, and wrappers in nco_netcdf.c

2005-10-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Support pnetCDF in bld/Makefile

	* Deprecate nco_fl_typ (never-used) from nco_netcdf.c wrappers

	* Add ncompi_open(), first pnetCDF interface wrapper

2005-10-25  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Changes to support MacOSX better:
	- configure detects Darwin and inserts -fno-common
	- bits added to configure.eg to describe other dependencies of
	this flag for libnetcdf (3.x)
	- nco_bm.pl detects Darwin and tests for bad cut.

2005-10-24  Daniel Wang  <wangd@uci.edu>

	* Implement barrier in mpncra.c, which should fix TODO nco593.

2005-10-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Initialize var->nc_id in ncpdq. Fixes TODO nco638.

	* Initialize dangling in_id in ncra, ncwa. Fixes TODO nco637.

	* Support netCDF4 NC_UBYTE,NC_USHORT,NC_UINT,NC_INT64,NC_UINT64
	in nco_netcdf.c wrapper functions for libnetcdf.a library

	* Support netCDF4 NC_UBYTE,NC_USHORT,NC_UINT,NC_INT64,NC_UINT64
	in metadata and some structures. Still need to add read/write and 
	conversion/promotion functions. 

2005-10-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Eliminate small [mp]ncra leak with -Y pseudonym

	* Fixed all known bugs with parallelization over in_id
	MPI (except for known problems) and MPI_FAKE regression tests all passed
	This resolves TODO nco611 and is opportune time to re-benchmark	SMP
	to check for any performance boost due to parallelization over in_id

	* #ifdef ENABLE_MPI spinlock -S switch so MPI_FAKE executables build

	* Finished re-parallelization of front-ends over in_id
	SMP operators appear to work, pass all tests on soot and ESMF

2005-10-21  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* configure[.in], Makefile[.in], src/nco/Makefile[.in] in good enough
	shape to commit.  Still some shakiness, but time to check clean checkouts
	on other platforms.  Now supports --enable-mpi, --enable-netcdf4
	
	* configure supports MacOSX build (detects OSX and deletes POSIX flag).

2005-10-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up old aborted attempt to parallelize ncecat over files

	* Verfied that parallelizing use of in_id in SMP code allows
	parallel read access to file data with nco_get_var*() in ncra.
	Hence, removed last critical read region from libnco.a
	SMP on other (non-ncra) operators temporarily broken until 
	I parallelize their front end use of in_id.

	* Re-wrote nco_omp_ini() logic to use stubs outside of #ifdefs
	Now UP and SMP execute virtually same code in nco_omp_ini()

	* Prototype and declare OpenMP stub functions in nco_omp.c/h

2005-10-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replaced many instances of var->nc_id with function parameter
	nc_id to possible parallelization over nc_id in calling routine.
	Most code was already written this way.

	* Realized that TODO nco28 is bogus and deleted it:
	"Use var.nc_id as file ID from now on and rewrite old routines to do so"
	Bad idea because it would prevent parallelizing over nc_id in SMP code

	* Improve warning message for non-monotonicity in rec_crd_chk() to
	better distinguish inter-file from intra-file non-monotonicity.

2005-10-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Mark all routines containing nco_put_var*() calls as OpenMP
	critical regions. Most nco_put_var*() calls occur in top level 
	routines and were already enclosed in critical regions.
	Routines newly marked tended to be "under the radar" exceptions
	present only in programs which were not parallelized (e.g., ncks).
	These include: nco_cpy_var_val_mlt_lmt(), 
	However, at least one routine, arm_time_install(), contained
	a write statement which I had forgotten all about.

	* Mark all routines containing nco_get_var*() calls as potential 
	OpenMP critical regions (they are critical when called with
	identical nc_id's). 
	These include: arm_base_time_get(), nco_cnv_ccm_ccsm_cf_date(),
	nco_prn_var_val_lmt(), nco_msa_rec_calc(), nco_var_get()

	* Mark nco_var_mtd_refresh() as non-OpenMP Critical
	Based on discussions with Unidata, metadata access (as opposed to
	data access) is thread-safe because all metadata is cached when
	file is opened.

2005-10-17  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>
	
	* Updated index.shtml to include Benchmark info

2005-10-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify netcdf4 features work on Ubuntu AMD64 (sand) and Libranet x86 (elnino)

2005-10-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Alphabetize lists in Makefile.am

2005-10-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Re-working SMP code to open files in parallel mode

	* Update MANIFEST

	* Change MACOSX to include sys/time.h rather than time.h so that
          struct timeval is defined before use in struct rusage

2005-10-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Insert stub for MPI documentation

	* Finish netCDF4 documentation in manual

	* Commit netCDF4 output support for all operators
	  New options -4,--4,--64bit,--fl_fmt,--netcdf4 control file format
	
	* ncks: Eliminate --fmt,--format synonyms to avoid netCDF4 confusion
          Change --sng to --sng_fmt

2005-10-12  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

   * added --enable-netcdf4 to configure, configure.in to find the bits
     necessary (libhdf5, libhdf_hl) to build the netcdf4 version of NCOs
     (TODO bld52)

	* mods to mk_bm_plot.pl to zero time axis (TODO bld56), compute
	  regression and place on plots (TODO bld57), 

2005-10-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* netCDF4 causes a regression in ncpdq packing/unpacking TODO nco615

2005-10-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove USE_FORTRAN_ARITHMETIC from bld/Makefile

	* Support netCDF4 in bld/Makefile

	* nco_create_mode_prs() interprets user-specified file format

	* nco_create_mode_mrg() merges clobber mode with user-specified file format

2005-10-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add netCDF4 file writing capability to ncks
	Compatibility tokens are in nco.h so netCDF3 libraries do not complain

	* Change NETCDF4 to ENABLE_NETCDF4

2005-10-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add hooks to move ncra.c threading to embrace file opens

2005-09-30  Daniel Wang  <wangd@uci.edu>

	* Branch mpncra.c to reorganize and understand nco593

2005-09-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up mpncra.c by removing barriers, adding comments

	* Remove superfluous close/open fl_in for MPI mpncra/mpncrcat/mpncea

2005-09-28  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Added --dust_user to allow setting a user that can log
		into dust for testing (hmangalm@esmf -> hjm@dust)

	* Fixed file tests broken in nco_bm.pl re-org.
	
	* Fixed udp reporting as per ditto.

2005-09-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement static executable option to bld/Makefile with STC=Y

2005-09-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move final worker open/close calls to with ncra/ncea block

	* Change NC_WRITE to NC_WRITE|NC_SHARE in MPI codes

2005-09-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Include Daniel's signal suspend code (-S switch) in mpncra

	* Use nco_set_fill() prior to each worker write

2005-09-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove nco_tst.pl from distribution

2005-09-23  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Check for IP#/hostname conflicts, LAM/lamd,
	 and MPICH/mpd in nco_bm.pl to help debug MPI errors.

2005-09-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change remaining NCAR_CCSM references to CCM_CCSM_CF

2005-09-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Filter garbage files from bld/Makefile tags target

	* Tokenize/variable-ize various static MPI-related constants
	This is intended to improved readability and literate programming-ness
	Replaced naked constants with following compile-time tokens/enums:
	mgr_id,WORK_ALLOC,WORK_REQUEST,TOKEN_ALLOC,TOKEN_REQUEST,TOKEN_RESULT,
	NO_MORE_WORK,TOKEN_WAIT,TOKEN_ALLOC
	
	* Create new header nco_mpi.h for all MPI-specific header information
	Currently this header is only accessed by main() MPI programs 
	Hence it is not (yet) part of libnco.a
	Header assumes its inclusion is already conditional on ENABLE_MPI
	This is currently a header mostly for pre-processor tokens 
	with few odd file scope constants needed by MPI routines 
	There are no functions yet
	Adding functions would require creating a corresponding *.c file
	Adding *.c file requires including it in libnco.a or separately linking
	MPI executables to it, i.e., slightly complicating the build procedure.
	I'm not yet sure I want _any_ MPI link dependencies in libnco.a 
	Cross-platform link weirdness (e.g., AIX) makes this something to avoid
	as long as possible

2005-09-20  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* added --xdata to nco_bm.pl to allow commandline data path to be entered
	(to allow benchmarking on different filesystems without resetting
	DATA env var).

2005-09-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tweak ncatted expected answer to pass hdr_pad test with new nco_bm.pl

	* Hack nco_bm* to pass thr_nbr,omp_flg,nco_D_flg

        * Re-remove prohibition on mpi_prc and thr_nbr simultaneously defined

	* Add mpi_fake_cp target to overwrite nc* with mpnc* (for AIX tests)

	* SMP mpncwa fails regression test 4 when thr_nbr > 1. TODO nco604.

	* All SMP mpnc*.c codes now compile cleanly

	* Fix SMP mpncpdq TODO nco598 by calling nco_close() once not twice

2005-09-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* SMP mpncpdq fails ncpdq regression test 4. This is TODO nco598.
	
	* Add mpi_cln target to bld/Makefile to remove MPI executables
	This makes it simple to build/erase all MPI_FAKE executables	

	* Yesterday's MPI_FAKE mpncea fix broke MPI mpncea regression test 1
	Today's fix works with SMP and MPI mpncea/mpncra/mpncrcat
	Testing shows this fix does nothing about ncrcat hanging TODO nco593
	
	* Add $HOME/nco/bm to Perl @INC so nco_bm.pl runs from directories
	(e.g., bld) from which bm is ../bm

	* Verify icc 9.0-compiled NCO works in UP/SMP/MPI modes

	* Add '/' to $prefix so nco_bm.pl works when executables in $MY_BIN_DIR 
	NB: nco_bm.pl does not run for me unless $MY_BIN_DIR is defined
	Probably same for other bld/Makefile users.
	
2005-09-16  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* added --mpi_fake (aka -mpi_fke aka --fake_mpi)  to allow running of
	the mpi executables as single processes.  Since my laptop cannnot yet
	generate valid MPI apps, I can't tell what the real reulst of running
	them is but the commandlines look right.

2005-09-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move mpncra.c nco_var_srt_zero() from MPI to common code so
	UP/SMP executables zero start vectors. Fixes mpncea bug TODO nco594. 

2005-09-16  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Re-org of regression and benchmarking script.  nco_bm.pl has
	been broken into 5 files:
	- nco_bm.pl - now does initialization and calls control scripts for
		benchmarking and regression
	- NCO_bm.pm - a Perl module that contains most of the functions
		except the regression tests.
	- NCO_rgr.pm - a Perl Module that contains only the regression tests
		to isolate them and make it easier to find the right one.
	- nco_bm_benchmarks.pl - the code chunk which is do-included that
		contains all the benchmark code.
	- nco_bm_md5wc_tbl.pl - the code chunk that contains all the md5 & wc
		checksums. (currently NOT working - see below)

	* the error/debug  messages have been cleaned up considerably and now
	are pumped out (mostly) at the end of each test if asked for.

	* a LOT of cruft was stripped out.  There was quite a bit of duplicate
	code, commented out code, 	code that didn't seem to be perl code.
	It's not all gone, but a lot of it is.

	* the only thing that definitely does not work at this point is the
	MD5 checking due to some particulary hairy namespace problems.
	
	* the MPI versions of the checks have not been tested yet either, 
	altho the commandlines it generates are correct.

	* I belive it is up to date with the latest regression tests and 
	benchmarks.  The relevant bits were diffed against the current code
	and they appear to be in sync.

2005-09-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Port ncwa 20050608 bugfix for DO_CONFORM_[MSK,WGT] to mpncwa
	
	* mpncea hangs on ncea regression test 4 (on sand with LAM) TODO nco597

	* Use fake end scopes to correct Emacs indentation in mpncra.c, mpncpdq.c

	* Test all FAKE_MPI mpnc* operators in place of nc* counterparts
	FAKE_MPI mpncea fails one test (TODO nco594) (regardless of thr_nbr)

	* Implement/fix OpenMP in MPI_FAKE portions of all mpnc*.c codes

	* Use icc ncecat bld/Makefile compilation fix for mpicc too 

	* Use nco_mpi_get() to return MPI implementation information
	Invoke with undocumented ncks --mpi switch
	This (unwisely?) introduces mpi.h into libnco.a via nco_ctl.h 
	Formerly, mpi.h only appeared in front-end codes
	Still no MPI _calls_ are in libnco.a, just header information
	
	* Allow MPI and OpenMP to both be true
	Now MPI_FAKE tests OpenMP so that MPI_FAKE operators are
	plug-compatible replacements for UP/SMP operators.
	No code actually takes advantage hybrid MPI/OMP since the MPI and
	OpenMP implementations are currently orthogonal in mpnc*.c level. 
	This may change if benchmarks uncover good reasons to hybridize
	
	* Accomodate LAM MPI environment
	No difference between regressions with LAM and with MPICH2

2005-09-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remaining MPI bugs do not appear to be NCO-caused memory problems

	* valgrind.txt suppressions are complete for default MPI
	configurations on ashes (mpich2, valgrind 2.2, gcc 4.0.0) and
	elnino (mpich2, valgrind 3.0.1, icc 8.1)

	* Make LAST_RECORD shared in OpenMP portion of mpncra.c

	* ncea regression test 3 is bizarre: ncea and MPI mpncea pass it,
	MPI_FAKE mpncea fails it. This is TODO nco594.

	* Verify UP and SMP mpncra execute successfully while MPI mpncra
	still hangs just before writing output file
	
	* Clean up mpncra.c to build cleanly with MPI_FAKE

	* Fix mpncecat (same ole' strlen(fl_out_tmp) bug)

	* Change all valgrind suppressions examples to use
	${HOME}/nco/doc/valgrind.txt, a direct copy of ${HOME}/c++/valgrind.txt

	* New MPICC, MPICXX logic in Makefile simplifies OS-specific sections
	AIX MPI builds must be done from scratch, i.e., make cln;make MPI=Y
	AIX MPI builds break non-MPI operators
	Hence a complete set of AIX executables requires two makes

	* Add valgrind suppressions for MPICH2 to ~/c++/valgrind.txt
	With these suppressed, valgrind finds no NCO-caused leaks in mpncbo
	MPID_* appears to cause a few harmless leaks

	* Move nco_free(cmd_ln) from master processor code to NCO-generic
	memory clean-up to avoid small leak in MPI'd operators

	* Regression test shows mpncbo commutivity modifications work!
	Same two-file framework should be implemented in ncflint/mpncflint

	* Only allow master MPI process to strlen(fl_out_tmp) 
	This fixes nasty regressions which I introduced into Gayathri's codes
	Still need to understand why it caused the bug in the first place

2005-09-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move TOKEN_FREE=True to after nco_close() after nco_var_val_cpy()

	* Declare all MPI-specific variables in one place in mpncbo.c
	This removes all warnings when spoofing MPI with MPI_FAKE
	
	* Clean up bld/Makefile header

	* Rename FAKE_MPI switch to MPI_FAKE in bld/Makefile

2005-09-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change $caseid and $xpt_dsc to traditional meanings in nco_bm.pl

	* Add MPI CMD_LN's to nco_bm.sh for MPI regressions/bm's in loadleveler

	* Change pvmgetarch location from ~/bin/sh to ~/sh everywhere

2005-09-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Update bld/Makefile to work with MPICH2 rather than MPICH

	* Add doc/mpi.txt to document MPI environments for NCO

2005-09-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Pruned chapter/section/node titles

	* Found that many/most MPI tests complete successfully on soot (fedora)
	MPI failures on debian may be temporary/unreliable
	Documented different test results in MPI section of TODO

	* Committed recent mpncbo.c commutivity changes
	
2005-09-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Complete and clean-up NCO MPI synonyms in prg_prs()

2005-09-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change CPP consistently with CC for Linux MPI compiles
	This ensures CPP finds mpi.h's hidden in strange directories

	* Add FAKE_MPI switch to compile MPI executables without MPI

	* Fix sundry compiler warnings with MPI front end codes

	* Port ncbo commutivity changes to mpncbo.c
	  Resulting SPMD executable mpncbo hangs where previous mpncbo works
          Refrain from committing new mpncbo.c until it works

2005-09-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add ncrcat to regression test. Test chosen hangs with MPI.

	* Make mpncra regression first ncra test for faster failure

	* Change sftp regression test to succeed by breaking into two steps
	so that automatic sftp "Fetching..." string does not confuse tester

	* Allow mpncbo regression test to fail TODO 579

2005-09-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* mpncra.c: Correct printf arguments for type

	* Change bld/Makefile MPI handling so CFLAGS gets used

2005-08-22 Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_0_2
	Changes since nco-3_0_1: icc, OPeNDAP, ftp, sftp, .netrc, hdr_pad,
	cf, bm for MPI + OPeNDAP 

	* Plug two small leaks in ncks when printing and fl_out=NULL

	* Plug double-free() error when fl_out=NULL in ncatted
	Double-free() errors cause operator failure on Fedora, which 
	has a security-hardened glibc. Hence this was probably an
	unreported headache for many Fedora NCO users since 3.0.0 or
	3.0.1. Recommend they upgrade and this spurs release of 3.0.2.

	* Add regression tests for ncatted mss_val and hdr_pad features

	* Remove duplicate nc_enddef() from ncatted and ncrename

2005-08-19 Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncbo status: Works better than ever as far as I can tell. Now it:
	1. Correctly handles cases where input variable orders are different
	2. Correctly diagnoses (and attempts to broadcast) mis-matched dimensions
	3. Can serve as template for similar [mp]ncflint re-write (TODO 578)
	4. Improved logic needs to be merged into mpncbo.c so mpncbo 
	   passes (currently deprecated) regression test ncbo #8 (TODO 579).
	5. Works well when nbr_var_fix_1>nbr_var_fix_2 so long as discrepant
	   variables are type fix not type prc but needs list merge to
	   work when nbr_var_fix_1<nbr_var_fix_2 (TODO 581).
	6. Works for rank(var_1) > rank(var_2), not rank(var_2) > rank(var_1) 
	   Pre-compute broadcast size before var_def(out_id,var_out) (TODO 552)

	* Completely fixes TODO 550. Serial NCO regression test is spotless again.

	* Plug memory leak caused by ncbo two list re-write 

2005-08-19  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Mods to nco_bm.pl to include but skip flaky mpi versions of ncpdq ncra

	* added alias line to accept mpncra

2005-08-19 Charlie Zender <zender@uci.edu>

	* Invert order of operands given to nco_var_sbt() by ncbo
	This fixes numerics of ncbo regression TODO 550
	However, operand order to nco_var_[sbt,dvd,...] is non-intuitive
	and should be reversed NCO-wide in the future (now TODO 576)	

2005-08-18 Charlie Zender <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add SFTP and .netrc-based password-protected FTP (to ESG) regression tests
	
	* Add stub for wget-based regression test

	* Fix ncbo regression to fail for right reason

	* Re-work nco_bm.pl net tests to all (potentially) pass for anyone

2005-08-17  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Add MPI bits to nco_bm.pl to test the MPI'ed operators.
        
2005-08-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add MPI_PRC option for bld/Makefile to pass through to nco_bm.pl

	* Add --hdr_pad/--header_pad options to ncatted and ncrename

	* Document --hdr/--header options

2005-08-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement --hdr/--header options to ncks with nco__enddef()

	* Add hooks for output file-mode specification to ncks.c
	This may break compatibility with netCDF nersion 3.5.x and hence OPeNDAP
	Currently shrouded by #ifdef NETCDF4 tokens
	
2005-08-12  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* small mods to nco_bm.pl to track diff in wall vs (sys+user) to 
		get idea of how much time is lost to I/O (theoretically)
        
2005-08-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finished ncbo heart transplant: Symmetric subtraction still not working
	Regression tests appears to be no worse than before (ncbo causes 2 fails)
	Valgrind indicates new code is leak-proof except for one
	double-free() caused by ncap_var_cnf_dmn()
	Code appears to be commit-able since it's cleaner and extensible
	
	* Extended dual list method into heart of ncbo
	Saved last known working version as ~/ncbo.last_known_working.c
	
	* Change NCAR_CCSM_FORMAT to CNV_CCM_CCSM_CF, ARM_FORMAT to CNV_ARM

2005-08-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement -Z/--64-bit-offset switch in ncatted and ncrename

	* Deprecate ctime_r() code from ncatted, put it (deprecated) into ncra

	* Add -4, --hdf, --netcdf4 switches to request HDF storage format


2005-08-08  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* change nco_fl_utl.c to use passive ftp rather than active
		(many ftp servers no longer work with active requests)

	* change nco_bm.pl to do net tests (except for those requiring a 
		specific login	or location).  Tests ftp (see 1st change) and 
		DODS if compiled with DODS/DAP.
2005-08-08  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* final updates to nco_bm.pl for testing DAP (reduced number of 
		files requested under DAP (also becasue of bug in DAP that
		refuses > 30 files at once in some cases.

	* changed Makefile.in to work with 'make test' & 'make devtest'

2005-08-05  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* cleaned out refs to '-n' in ncflint.c (doesn't support it)

	* major mods to nco_bm.pl to add DODS support to testing

	* may be a bug in DODS server code that doesn't allow >30 files in 
		one session - posted.

2005-08-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added msk_* to ncbo's do not touch list for CF

2005-08-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added area, lat_bnds, lon_bnds to ncbo's do not touch list for CF

	* Re-wrote Conventions section in terms of CF rather than CCSM

2005-07-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Re-coded so NCO uses .netrc, if present, only when .netrc is
	read-able and contains remote host name.
	Anonymous FTP is automatically invoked if .netrc does exist or
	does not contain remote host name.
	Henceforth NCO access to password protected FTP sites (like ESG) is scriptable!

	* FTP uses .netrc, if present, in all cases instead of anonymous FTP
	This essentially breaks anonymous FTP 
	
2005-07-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finished SFTP support in nco_fl_mk_lcl()
	Syntax is sftp://hostname:/filename
	Updated manual accordingly

	* Add Gayathri's latest mpncra.c to distribution and Makefile

2005-07-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change test1.sh to use CWD ncks so cygwin works
	We should deprecate the FTP and DODS tests and move to nco_bm.pl

2005-07-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add .netrc information to FTP description in manual

	* Add hooks for sftp support in nco_fl_utl()

	* Improve OPeNDAP examples in manual

2005-07-15  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Change UDP log format from nco_bm.pl to make for better parsing

	* Add new script to bm dir (mk_bm_plots.pl) to convert UDP data to
	  postscript plots for each operator (currently wall, real, sys,
	  user time) but can add output of rusage if it looks useful as well.

2005-07-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* MPI NCO with icc 9.0 appears to work on dual Opterons!

	* OpenMP NCO with icc 9.0 passes regression tests on dual Opterons!

	* Change nco_mmr_typ to enumerated type to fix icc warning on Opteron

	* Put more icc flags in configure.in

	* MPI NCO with icc 8.1 successfully compiles and execute on Fedora
	It failed to execute with message "lamd not running"
	until "lamboot" command was executed first to setup LAM/MPI
	environment. Debian machines need no such initial setup.
	After logging out and in once, MPI NCO ran fine without having
	to run lamboot first. Apparently it's just a one-time setup
	(per machine? or per user?)

	* Verified that MPI NCO works with GCC on dual opteron machines

	* Add -D_POSIX_SOURCE to default gcc and icc flags to fix compiler
	warnings in ncap_lex.l

	* Add -D_BSD_SOURCE to default icc flags to fix MPI with icc

2005-07-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified icc passes regressions tests and icpc-compiled
	libnco_c++.a works as intended. Have not tried with autotools yet.
	Have not yet tested MPI programs with icc.

	* -axW flag causes icc 8.1 to die compiling ncecat 
	This appears to be an icc bug
	Implement target-specific workaround in bld/Makefile
	
	* Implement Intel 8.1 compiler compatibility

2005-07-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix small leak in ncap_var_stretch() TODO ncap74
	ncap now appears to be leak-proofed!
	
	* Added lots or mirror fl_1=fl_2 code to ncbo in preparation 
	for attempted solution to subtraction problems related to
	asymmetry. In plain English: copied lots of code, didn't solve any
	problems yet.

	* Add td,tx,ty,tz,txyz variables to in.cdl

	* Match limit with dimension based on name not ID so
	nco_dmn_lmt_mrg() works with single limit list on any input file

2005-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Realized that ncbo bug is longstanding/systemic and may
	require re-writing approach to determining confmormality of var_2. 
	Current code is expected to break when second file has same name
	but different-sized dimensions, or has same-sized dimensions in
	different order, i.e., all sort of corner-cases.
	
2005-07-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove thr_nbr argument from ncatted in nco_bm.pl

	* DAP 3.5.1 triggers reproducible double-free() memory error in
	ncbo step of ncra regression test 16.
	Problem occurs regardless of OpenMP (soot,elnino) and compiler (gcc,icc)
	ncra -O -C -v rec_var_flt_mss_val_dbl ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo_avg.nc
	ncbo -O -C -v rec_var_flt_mss_val_dbl ~/nco/data/in.nc ~/foo_avg.nc ~/foo.nc
	free(): invalid pointer 0x80e4a98!
	
	* Verified DAP 3.5.1 works with both build mechanisms with
	gcc NCO/gcc DAP (Debian elnino), and with icc NCO/gcc DAP

	* Report NC_64BIT_OFFSET rather than old-fashioned LARGEFILE test
	with -r option in nco_lbr_vrs_prn()

	* Change 'DODS' to 'DAP' or 'OPeNDAP' where possible in codbase, 
	e.g., 'enable-dap', make DAP=Y, ENABLE_DAP

	* Support OPeNDAP 3.5.x in bld/Makefile

	* Re-write dods.sh for OPeNDAP 3.5.x terminology and save in new
	file opendap.sh

2005-06-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Critical region on OpenMP reads nco_get_vara() are still necessary
	Want to establish if this is NCO or netCDF problem
	Testing for reproducibility, following regressions on soot, esmf:

	Run        ncra		           ncwa
	soot 1     01                      01,13
	soot 2     02,06,10,11             none
	soot 3     01,04                   01
	esmf 1     01,02,11,12             none
	esmf 2     04,05,06,07,10,11,12,16 none
	esmf 3     02,03,04,09,15,16       13

	Regressions are non-reproducible, characteristics of threads
	over-writing eachother due to random timing conflicts.
	Hard to debug because of irreproducibility

	Q: NCO calls nco_get_vara() in many routines---why is the call in
	nco_var_get() the only one that needs to be critical?
	A: Probably because it is that most important, done on every
	variable

	Options:
	1. Ask Unidata whether they have tested SMP robustness of netCDF 
	reads under demanding battery of conditions? 
	2. Scrutinize uninitialized data reported by icc/valgrind? 
	3. Write own SMP on read test?
	4. ???
	
	* Finish making opaque types nco_byte, nco_char, nco_int self-consistent
	
2005-06-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@soot.ess.uci.edu>

	* Change nco_long to nco_int to allow for future 64-bit type called nco_long

	* Abstract opaque types into new header nco_typ.h

2005-06-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Explicitly cast NC_CHAR type as "char" (rather than "unsigned
	char") in nco_netcdf.c and nco.h. Previously, there were a mixture
	of "char" and "unsigned char" occurances. 
	Not sure if this helps anything except consistency

	* Removed two of three critical regions in nco_var_utl.c
	Removing these causes no regressions with SMP on icc/x86 or xlc/Power4
	Final critical region is, well, critical
	Region contains the nco_get_vara()/nco_get_var1() calls themselves

2005-06-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Conditionally free both $1 and $3 in var,var addition in ncap_yacc.y

	* Try and fail to free input variables if they were promoted in
	ncap_var_cnf_dmn(). Not sure what prevents this from working.

2005-06-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merge CCSM data processing example into nco.texi

2005-06-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Un-constify cvs_Name to workaround gcc-4.0+ warnings

2005-06-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix bld/Makefile indent that caused make to treat ncap: as
	command not rule 

2005-06-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make LINUX_CC more MPI-friendly for both gcc and icc
	'make MPI=Y' just works on my Debian machines now when
	MPICH_CC=gcc and fails when MPICH_CC=icc
	
	* Set OMP=N when MPI=Y in bld/Makefile

	* Add ${MDL_BIN_TRG} to .PHONY in bld/Makefile to solve problems
	with building MPI executables

	* Change configure.in 'case' statement from sparc-sun-solaris2
	to sparc-sun-solaris2* to handle newer solaris triplets

2005-06-21  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* fixed Makefile.in and nco_bm.pl to work with:
	make test      does regression test with no debug info
	make devtest   does regression test with debug info and udpreporting
	make benchmark runs benchmark with udpreporting
	make files     creates the benchmark files

	* nco_bm.pl now defaults to <nco_root>/src/nco as MY_BIN_DIR (if no
	environment var set) instead of going thru the dialog.

2005-06-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add sys target to bld/Makefile. 
	'make sys' installs executables in $MY_BIN_DIR to /usr/local/bin

2005-06-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified that nco_var_refresh() change does not introduce any
	memory errors on any operator. Marking TODO nco543 as closed.
	
	* Re-name nco_var_refresh() to nco_var_mtd_refresh() to better
	describe functionality (metadata, not data, is refreshed).

	* Refresh variable type in nco_var_refresh()
	Previously, only ID, nbr_dims, and mss_val were refreshed
	Now type is also refreshed. Was not sure full implications of this.
	It appears to work and causes no regressions
	Hence back out previous fix for nco543 and handle this way
	This is cleaner and more robust to varying variable types with
	each input file
	
	* Revert ncra input variable structure to unpacked type at end of 
	record loop
	Reverting input values is not necessary since those are free()d next
	However, type member of structure must be unpacked value so that 
	cast of new missing_value in nco_mss_val_get() in next 
	nco_var_refresh() call (i.e., next file)
	This solves TODO nco543 but will break when variables are different
	unpacked types between files and both files contain missing values.
	Better solution is to refresh variable type in nco_var_refresh()?
	Will commit this first then try that next
	Best solution is to carry missing_value type in variable structure?

2005-06-17  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Tested NCO with new (3.5.1) version of DAP/NC-DAP, with netcdf 3.6. 
	Seems to work for small transfers but hangs with large transfers 
	from sand's DODS server. Still testing. 
	Brought configure and Makefile and .in's up to date with new DAP. 
	May have to drop back to netcdf 3.5 tho.

2005-06-17  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Cleaned up mpncflint 
	
2005-06-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Convert var_prc[idx]->mss_val back to on-disk type after every
	record _except_ the last record in ncra. 
	This fixes valgrind memory error associated with TODO nco543
	Regression test still not passed, though no new regressions introduced

2005-06-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ncea regression test similar to current failing ncra TODO nco543
	
	* Remove call to nco_typ_cnv_rth() for var_prc[idx] in ncra and ncea
	Call appears redundant since variable is converted to output
	type with nco_var_cnf_typ() two lines later anyway.
	Removing nco_typ_cnv_rth() for var_prc[idx] causes no new failures 
	in regression tests.

	* Set default packing policy for all potential MPI ncpdq operators

2005-06-16  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Added new operators mpncwa, mpncpdq, mpncecat
	
	* Modified mpncbo so that all processes do the final clean-up
	
	* Modified nco_ctl.c and nco_pck.c to accommodate new MPI operators

2005-06-15  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Added a couple of tests for ncra (average
	(i)rec_var_int_mss_val_int (ii)rec_var_int_mss_val_flt across 2
	identical input files) in nco_bm.pl which seem to fail

2005-06-15  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

        * MD5 version of nco_bm.pl checked in - works on SV (Single Values) on 
	x86-32, x86-64, esmf.  Passes benchmarks on all these platforms. 
	on x86-32, passes all regressions except for funny-wrap-on-Intel regression,
	        passes all MD5 & WC tests for regression (except noted above)
		passes all benchmarks with MD5, WC, SV
	on x86-64, passes all regressions except ncap funny business (fails 3)
               passes all but 4 MD5 checks (makes sense in terms of what fails)
               passes all benchmarks on SV but fails all MD5 checks
        on AIX-64  passes all regressions but 4 of the ncaps tests
               passes all MD5 & WC tests for regression (except noted above)
               passes all benchmarks on SV but fails all MD5 checks

        * pick up DATA and MY_BIN_DIR correctly

	* reduce debugging cruft, tho in debug mode, it still burps text in ugly ways

2005-06-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add MD5 and SHA1 digests of nco.tar.gz to index.shtml

2005-06-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Improve threading code intention comments in nco_omp.c

	* Still need to tweak run and data directories in nco_bm.pl and nco_bm.sh

	* nco_bm.pl and nco_bm.sh appear to work with loadleveler
	Solution is not general yet because unable to pass environment
	variables (except DATA and HOME) through scripts for now
	
	* nco_bm.sh: Never pass strings with whitespace through Perl Getopt

	* nco_bm.pl: Print many arguments when dbg_lvl=1

2005-06-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noticed that regression tests in nco_bm.pl report some 
	apparent successes as failures on SUNMP, e.g., 
	Result: [1e+36] != Expected: [1e+36]
	always recorded as failure. 
	Seems like any "Expected's" containing "+" string may fail.
	Perl problem?

	* Ran benchmarks on laptop (elnino), desktop (soot), supercomputer
	(esmf). Noted that file creation is sickeningly slow on laptop and
	desktop, takes thousands of seconds. Fast on ESMF. Same on
	benchmarks: very slow on laptop and desktop, fast on ESMF
	interactive node. 

	* Add -t thr_nbr to nco_usg_prn() and nco.texi for newly threaded
	operators

	* Do not call ncap with threads in nco_bm.pl fl_cr8()

	* Allow nco_bm.pl to run locally from bld/Makefile

2005-06-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_0_1
	Changes since nco-3_0_0: 1. ncap exponentiation 2. ncwa threading
	3. intel icc compatibility 4. Improved benchmarking

	* Simplify treatment of math symbol table
	C99 mandates support for 
	erf(), erfc(),tgamma(), acosh(), asinh(), atanh(), cosh(), sinh(), tanh()
	Some OS's, like Linux, Solaris, provide these without C99.
	Many others (AIX, SGI*, WIN32) do not.
	Complicating things, many C99 implementations, e.g., AIX xlc, do
	not yet support these functions.
	Hence, ncap only supports them on Linux machines.
	
2005-06-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change default AMD64 compiler to gcc-4.0

	* Revert patches to known working state (i.e., make reads critical) 
	
	* Temporarily un-revert critical region patches in nco_var_get.c
	With icc and xlc_r, this causes variable numbers of ncra and ncwa 
	regressions. Usually many more ncra than ncwa.
	icc/valgrind combination gives capability to narrow down causes.
	
2005-06-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change thr_nbr_max_fsh from 1 to 2 for ncrcat

	* Change thr_nbr_max_fsh from unlimited to 2 for ncecat
	
	* Change thr_nbr_max_fsh from 1 to unlimited for ncwa

	* Change thr_nbr_max_fsh from 4 to unlimited for ncbo

	* Marked TODO nco325, nco345, nco523, nco189, nco214 as resolved

	* Re-ran all valgrind tests on soot with two threads enabled
	All operator appear memory clean in NCO portions except ncwa
	ncwa may have a few unfree()d buffers but hard to tell with
	valgrind version 2.2 which does not have good tracebacks.
	Threading library has plenty of unfree'd memory which apparently 
	is harmless and there's nothing to be done about that anyway.

	* ncbo memory problems disappeared

	* Add calls to nco_omp_ini() and nco_thr_att_cat() in ncecat
	This fixes problem where thr_nbr was being set but not used

	* Use icc warnings to improve printf() formatting in nco_prn.c

	* Optimize bld/Makefile icc switches for OPTS=O,R,D,X

	* Do not pass --thr_nbr to ncatted in nco_bm.pl

	* Change DO_CONFORM_MSK,DO_CONFORM_WGT from private to
	firstprivate and make sure both always have default values
	This fixed all ncwa regressions with threads!
	
	* icc-compiled version passes regression test perfectly on soot
	only when threading is disabled at compile time, e.g., OMP=N.
	With threading enabled, code fails many tests (1 ncra and 22 ncwa)
	....regardless of thread number! Not requesting any threads,
	(i.e., -t 0 or no -t specification), requesting one thread (-t 1),
	or requesting more threads breaks regression tests.	

	Interesting that AIX version passes all, and icc fails many,
	regressions when threading enabled with one thread.
	icc fails _most_ ncwa calls. Averaging a single variable fails!

	Lots of juiciness in error messages!
	icc will help to isolate any problems because it is so much more
	sensitive than xlc_r. Moreover, valgrind appears to work fine
	with icc-compiled OpenMP code on Xeon.
	
	* Code compiles as clean as possible with icc 8.1 and gcc 4.0

	* Prohibit double definition of cmp_nm with icc

	* Updated bld/Makefile and configure.in to work better for
	icc by making -std=c99 standard switch

	* Changed default compiler on Ubuntu to GCC-4.0
	Fixed new CEWI warnings resulting from change
	Testing shows no new regressions

	* Reverting the 20050519 critical region patches fixes ncra
	regressions on AIX OpenMP. Hypothesis that libnetcdf.a is not
	thread-safe on reads (or writes) gains considerable weight,
	since all the patches do, I think, is make reads critical.

	* Reverted 20050519 critical region patches

	* About to revert patches of 20050519 which removed critical
	regions from NCO read routines

	* Added nco.texi example on changing non-record to record dimensions

2005-06-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noticed that many ncra regression tests fail on AIX
	When did this begin? What causes it?
	Results from date-stamped-version tests 
	20050605: Fail; 
	20050524: Fail; 
	20050521: Fail; 
	20050520: Fail;
	20050519: Succeed;
	20050517: Succeed; 
	20050510: Succeed; 

2005-06-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add THR_NBR option to bld/Makefile to pass to nco_bm.pl

	* Learned that Linux gamma() function is just plain broken
	and obsoleted, at least in C99, by tgamma() function.
	Linking gamma() symbol to tgamma() intrinsic solves Linux problem
	Note that tgamma() is a C99 feature
	Referencing tgamma() in the code is the second C99 feature,
	after the restrict type keyword.
	
2005-06-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* gamma() function appears broken in ncap regression test 07

	* Added ncap regression tests for modulo, exponentiation, sin,
	cos, atan operations

2005-06-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Henry implemented ncap exponentiation bugfix. 
	Versions < 3.0.1 incorrectly handle exponentiation of a variable
	to a variable power (V^V). 

2005-05-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Account for typesize in allocation of ncap_ln_nbr_crr and
	ncap_fl_spt_glb in glb_init_free(). Fixes memory read/write error.

	* Began purifying ncap memory

	* ncks appears to be memory-pure!

	* Leak-proofed nco_msa.c 

2005-05-26  Hary Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* finally brought in ncecat in OMP form

	* changed configure.in configure scripts to reflect sync with
	bld/Makefile flags; (again) noted problem with static/shared and 
	DODS in configure.eg

	* accepted CZ's peculiar variable naming in bm script.

2005-05-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More fully initialize lmt_all_crr->lmt_dmn[0] to enable
	subsequent free()ing with nco_lmt_free()

	* Tidy up nco_cpy_var_dfn_lmt() prototype and use lmt_all
	rather than lmt to designate lmt_all rather than lmt structures

2005-05-26 Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld>

	* Changed in ncks.c lmt_all_lst from a 1D to a 2D variable
	also changed associated functions in nco_msa.[ch]

2005-05-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed from ctime() to re-entrant ctime_r() with ncatted
	Does not help reduce unfree()'d system memory according to
	valgrind 3.0 development branch. Does not hurt, either.
	How portable is ctime_r()? SUS, yes, but POSIX?
	
2005-05-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Touch parameter rusage_who for CEWI in nco_mmr_rusage_prn()

	* Fix double-free() problem in ncrename

2005-05-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add memory cleanup to sng_lst_cat()

	* Nearly purified ncatted memory

	* Purified ncrename memory

	* Began ncks memory cleanup

	* Fix union type-casting in nco_var_cnf_typ()

2005-05-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Debug statements for TODO nco523, vexing SMP OpenMP thread bug

	* Execute free(var_prc[idx]) sooner in ncwa

	* Re-tweak print formatting in nco_bm.pl

2005-05-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change nco_get_var*() routines in nco_var_get() from SMP
	critical to non-critical. Not sure why they were originally
	critical.

	* Change nco_var_upk*() routine in nco_var_get() from SMP
	critical to non-critical. Not sure why it was originally
	critical.

	* Make nco_var_refresh() routine from SMP non-critical. 
	Not sure why it was originally critical.

2005-05-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* All arithmetic operators except ncap now have no known memory
	leaks or errors

	* Finished memory cleanup on ncwa

2005-05-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Appear to have fixed all leaks in nco_var_avg()

	* Fix problem with dangling pointers in var_out caused by
	destruction/creation of var_prc_out in nco_var_avg().
	Solution adopted is somewhat hackish: rearranging nco_var_lst_free()s
	Perhaps better solution would be to copy new var_prc_out pointers into
	var_out, the free() memory normally.

	* Plug leak when nco_var_avg() called with variables without
	averaging dimensions (i.e., fixed variables). When this occurs,
	return copy of original input instead of NULL (old method).

	* Add cleanup_and_exit branch to nco_var_avg()

	* Never allocate tally array for var_prc[idx] in ncwa, since it is
	never used and caused double free() problems when it share the 
	var_prc_out[idx] tally buffer

2005-05-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Stop cross-referencing fix with var->xrf->xrf=fix in nco_var_avg()

	* Make nco_bm.pl output format for regression test look like configure

2005-05-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Reduced default verbosity of nco_bm.pl

	* Fixed ncap_var_init() prototype and nco_cnf_typ() to compile cleanly

2005-05-06 Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld>

	* Cleaned up double parsing in ncap.c,ncap_*.[hc] 
	  now passes basic tests

2005-05-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Comment out three_double_dmn from in.cdl to avoid triggering
	errors in DODS server and/or netCDF client library

2005-05-03  zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Threaded ncflint. Not tested yet.

2005-04-29  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Cleaning up mpncbo.c prior to replacing ncbo.c

2005-04-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cleaning up mpncbo.c prior to replacing ncbo.c

2005-04-25  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Updated mpncbo to compile with and without MPI. Compiling
	without MPI=Y will result in identical executables mpncbo and ncbo
	* Updated Makefile to reflect the same
	* Added mpncflint, the MPI version of ncflint

2005-04-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up main.c headers a little

2005-04-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cd to bm for all bm targets in bld/Makefile

2005-04-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed/added 'make tst' targets in bld/Makefile to use
	nco_bm.pl instead of nco_tst.pl

	* Finished ncecat cleanup

2005-04-19  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* (Apparently) fixed the bug in mpncbo while hyperslabbing

2005-04-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@soot.ess.uci.edu>

	* Initial ncecat memory cleanup---still one problem with dimension list

2005-04-19  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Large cleanup of benchmark code
	  integrated file build, benchmark, and regression testing
	  udp reporting only by request

	* added --queue to denote submission to queue (loadleveller, etc)
	which kills off script if the proper env vars aren't set.  If --queue
	isn't set, and env vars aren't set, script will prompt for correct paths
	added Failure column to summary output to make it easier to see which
	ones failed.

	* added nco commandline to UDP report so can verify timing exactly. 

	* added --thr_nbr to option list to set # of threads to use (not
          implemented internally yet tho)

	* finished adding those benchmarks that CZ wants added:
		1 - ncwa averaging all variables to scalars 
		2 - ncra time-averaging 2^5 (i.e., one month) files (using symlinks)
		3 - ncea averaging 2^5 files 
		4 - ncbo differencing two files (using '-' as operator)
		5 - DEFERRED (Martin Schultz multi-slabbing test)
		6 - ncap long algebraic operation 
		7 - ncpdq packing the file 
		8 - ncpdq dimension-order reversal the file 

	* above benchmarks complete cleanly on sand and on those that can be done
	  on bodi

2005-04-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* With following six modifications, mpncbo compiles, runs and
	gives apparently correct results on my laptop with default run.
	However, mpncbo exits with errors when hyperslabs are specified,
	e.g., mpncbo -d lon,1 ...
	
	* Synchronize mpncbo memory clean-up with latest ncbo

	* Fix lmt handling in mpncbo as per 20050416 changes

	* Add prototype for nco_mpi_att_cat() to nco_att_utl.h

	* Add mpncbo synonym for ncbo in prg_prs() and nco_op_typ_get()

	* Remove #ifdefs around nco_mpi_att_cat() which requires no
	additional MPI-specific headers so is always safe to compile

	* Change MPI attribute to nco_mpi_task_number

2005-04-18  Gayathri Venkitachalam  <gvenkita@uci.edu>

	* Checked in mpncbo.c & nco_att_utl.c after updating them to
	compile with MPI=Y. Compiling with MPI=N still behaves the way it
	used to.
	
2005-04-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Memory status:
	The only commonly used code which has leaks/errors in the arithmetic
	operators (excluding ncap) appears to be the dimension conformance
	code, i.e., broadcasting. ncwa highlights these problems.
	ncbo, ncea, ncflint, ncpdq, ncra, ncrcat are either memory-clean
	or causes of problems are known and await resolution.
	ncecat has yet to be examined but is expected to respond well to 
	same treatment given to ncea/ncra/ncrcat.

	Problem #1: Promotion of char->double (and byte->double?) uses
	uninitialized memory. This may be a C-language or libc problem,
	ultimately, which we can do nothing about. Not sure. It is not
	serious because promotion of char->double for arithmetic is
	intrinsically ill-defined and rarely used. It would be helpful
	to document this problem in the manual, and possibly give users
	some control over code paths, e.g.,
	--disable_promote_char_double. 

	Problem #2: nco_var_cnf_dmn(), in its various incarnations and
	uses, leaks worse than Harry's roof. 
	The upside is that it is memory-efficient and fast.
	This problem is serious and needs careful fixes.

	Problem #3: ncap. I have not examined ncap since fixing the huge
	ncap_var_stretch() leak. There seem to be many tiny leaks
	in the flex and bison-generated code, which surprises me.
	If these really are leaks, not sure what we can do beyond 
	creating a valgrind suppression file for them. 
	
2005-04-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up leaks in file name code when abbreviation lists used
	Solving leak in nco_fl_nm_prs() was rather contorted but appears
	to work
	
	* Fix off-by-two error in memmove() in ncwa

2005-04-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Initial memory work on ncflint

	* Currently, memory in ncpdq and ncbo appears faultless
	memory in ncra has one problem when up-converting char to double
	for averaging

	* Tighten up memory in ncwa by free()ing dimension lists
	
	* Changed limit (lmt) memory paradigm from 1D to 2D structure list
	in accord with all string, variable, and dimension lists.
	This makes handling limits easier, at the expense of more indirect
	referencing in metadata routines. Replace lmt[idx]. with lmt[idx]->
	All lmt-related memory leaks appear to be gone
	
2005-04-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Gayathri noted problem with missing_value inconsistency between
	var_prc and var_prc_out for identical input files on both packed
	and unpacked variables. Still investigating.

	* Case where var2 did and var1 did not have missing_value was
	treated incorrectly in ncbo.c and inconsistently in
	nco_mss_val_cnf(). Fixed.

2005-04-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noticed that Fedora core 2 glibc automatically warns about
	double free()s etc and that regression test doesn't look so
	hot when all these are printed. More reasons to fix the remaining
	memory problems...

	* Fixed AIX regression for printing bytes by moving from
	non-standard %hhi format (which printed all bytes as "hi" on AIX) 
	to standard %c format, which is lame and does not print signed
	integer values for bytes. Now it should not trigger regressions.

	* Added mpncbo.c as MPI-enable ncbo alternative
	Builds only with bld/Makefile using make MPI=Y switch
	and requires MPI packages (e.g., mpich) and access to mpi.h
	Has not been verified not to break autotools builds yet
	
2005-04-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed all memory leaks in simplest ncbo calls

2005-04-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Free() dmn_lst in all applicable operators

	* Free() xtr_lst in all applicable operators

	* Free() cmd_ln in all operators

	* NULL'ify var_prc_out[idx]->tally when free'ing
	var_prc[idx]->tally in ncra. This fixes double free() condition
	caused because these both point to same buffer.

2005-04-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement preliminary memory free routines in ncra
	Fairly straightforward---best place to start now that ncpdq is done

	* Implement preliminary memory free routines in ncwa
	Clear that limit structures will need some deep work
	Genuine memory errors do occur and give hope that ultimately
	ridding all ncwa problems may be possible by fixing leaks
	
	* Implement preliminary memory free routines in ncap and
	immediately give up due to size and scope of job

	* Move list free functions to respective utility routine files

	* Changed names of ncap routines that maniputlated nm_id structures
	These routines used the *_var_* nomenclature, e.g., nco_var_lst_free(), 
	even though they manipulated lists of nm_id_sct structures.
	Changed *_var_* to *_nm_id_* in these functions so that routines
	are named after structure types which they manipulate, rather than
	what their contents are
	
	* Created new routines to free lists of lmt, dmn, var structures

	* ncpdq is officially leak-free! The first leak-free operator

	* var_nm is finally free'd, takes care of TODO nco224

	* Fixed bug in nco_var_cnf_dmn() and nco_var_stretch() where
	var->nm pointer was being copied instead of deep-copying
	This appears to have fixed ncwa regression TODO nco490
	
	* Verified that var->nm freeing is last obstacle to perfect memory
	releases in ncpdq

2005-04-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Simplify nco_lmt_udu_cnv() because of new lst_prs_2D() list processing

	* Transition all of NCO from lst_prs_1D() to lst_prs_2D()
	All operators still pass regression test

	* Use nco_sng_lst_free() to free fl_lst_in in ncpdq

	* Transition ncpdq from lst_prs_1D() to lst_prs_2D()
	All operators still pass regression test

2005-04-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Patch nco_mmr.h to include time.h.
	Fixes Mac OS X build for struct rusage

	* Change default printing behavior of ncks again using suggestion
	of Takeshi Enomoto. 
	ncks in.nc : Prints all data and metadata
	ncks -M in.nc : Prints only global metadata
	ncks -m in.nc : Prints only variable metadata
	ncks -H in.nc : Prints only variable data

2005-03-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Create lst_1D_to_2D() to replace lst_prs(), which is responsible
	for much craziness and was renamed lst_prs_old().
	Unfortuneately, immediately switching showed many regressions
	lst_1D_to_2D() needs more extensive testing

	* Implement nco_sng_lst_free() to free string lists

	* More fixes to ncpdq memory management...only one leak remains!

2005-03-26  charlie  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Introduced unknown regression into ncwa nco_var_cnf_dmn()

	* Pared ncpdq unfree'd memory down to three, final,
	hard-to-understand, problem malloc's totaling ~150 B.

	* Free dmn_rdr_lst_in() in ncpdq

	* Fix inherent leak in prg_prs()

	* Deep-copy nm in nco_var_dpl(); free nm in nco_var_free()
	Ditto with dmn->nm, nco_dmn_dpl(), and nco_dmn_free()
	
	* Implement nco_dmn_free() to free dimensions

	* Guaranteed system memory (optarg) reaches no further than
	command-line parsing in all operators. This has side effect
	of temporarily increasing un-free'd memory in programs, because,
	formerly, valgrind would not count that memory against NCO because
	it was system memory (optarg). Now NCO owns it and needs to free
	it. 

	* Planning to eliminate all remaining memory leaks from NCO
	Un-free'd strings cause the most memory leaks (I think)
	When NCO originated in 1993-1994 I was zealous about memory usage. 
	I chose to use the system memory allocated to optarg rather than
	duplicate that memory in NCO. As NCO grew and became more
	object-oriented, being able to create structures (e.g., variables)
	dynamically but not able to free all their elements (e.g., names),
	some of which referenced system memory (from optarg), lead to today.

	Here are four examples (from ncks.c) of memory that NCO cannot free():
	fl_pth_lcl=optarg;
	fl_pth=optarg;
        dlm_sng=optarg;
        var_lst_in=lst_prs(optarg,",",&nbr_xtr);
	The first two or three lines do no cause much problem because
	those strings are not duplicated much or contained in structures
	and so never lead to situations that valgrind count against NCO
	Using system memory for var_lst_in, however, causes problems
	
	Strategy:
	1. Replace all such fragments in NCO by strdup()'d memory
	2. Follow their code paths and free() these strings when possible
	3. Add block to free all pointers at end of code (already in ncpdq)	
	4. Modify destructors (e.g., nco_var_free()) to free strings
	
	Initial work to free memory will be conducted in ncpdq
	Implement same methods in other operators once ncpdq is leak-free...
	
2005-03-25  charlie  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Documented and fixed some small ncap memory leaks with valgrind

2005-03-24  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* added bm dir for benchmarking; initial files are:
        gne_exp.cdl       template -> ~54MB file of gene expression data
        ipcc_dly_T85.cdl  template -> ~1GB file with 4D,3D,2D,1D,scalar variables
        ipcc_dly_T85.sh   shell file that creates & populates the above file
        nco_bm.pl         the perl benchmarking script (derived from bld/nco_tst.pl)
        sml_fls.sh        script to generate both small files: gne_exp.cdl & sml_stl.cdl
        sml_stl.cdl       template for a small sat data file
        stl_5km.cdl       template for ~300MB sat data file
        stl_5km.sh        script to generate and ncap the above file
    
2005-03-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-3_0_0
	Changes since nco-2_9_9: 1. ncap bugfix 2. Add benchmarking
	3. libnco_c++ implements nco_var_puta()

2005-03-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix gaping memory leak in ncap_var_stretch()

2005-03-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement nco_mmr_rusage_prn() for memory diagnostics

2005-03-21  charlie  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented Harry's suggestion to use memset(vp,0,size)
	to initialize float and integer buffers to zero.
	Previously, this was done in a loop over each index value
	Presumably this old method was slower because of pointer de-referencing
	New algorithm implemented in nco_var_zero() and nco_zero_long()

	* Set NC_NOFILL in ncap_var_write()

	* The call to nco_aed_prc() (a metadata writing call) was 
	un-necessarily late in ncap.c. I moved it to just after
	nco_var_dfn(). This takes advantage of the netCDF feature that
	metadata (not data) can be manipulated before it is flushed to
	disk (with nc_enddef()). You can learn/use a variable's ID 
	before populating the variable's data section. 
	Now ncap ends after writing in data mode and avoids the heavy disk
	penalty of moving variables to accomodate  the increased metadata from
	the nco_aed_prc() call. 

	* Turns out the only NC_NOFILL in ncap.c was done in data mode 
	after the variables were defined. 
	Not sure why this did not cause an error.
	ncap was probably doing redundant data filling for the non-processed
	variables defined. 
	Fixed that.

2005-03-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Apply same optimization to nco_var_cnf_dmn()

	* Handle expansion of scalar variable as special case in
	ncap_var_stretch() to speed up important cases of variable
	synthesis. This speeds up user-time ipcc_dly_T85 benchmark
	by ~300%.

2005-03-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Modified big.cdl to facilitate benchmarks

2005-03-04  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* RE-Fixed configure, configure.in to find test for and add ssl to LIBS

2005-03-02  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* RE-Fixed configure, configure.in to find nc-dods lib
	 AND also to treat UDUnits correctly if it's built and used from 
	 a local directory.

2005-02-24  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* Fixed configure, configure.in to find nc-dods lib

2005-02-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Long options --prn --print now point to -P instead of -H

	* Introduced -P as abbreviation for -C -H -M -m -u

	* Restored -H -m -M functionality to old behavior mostly

	* Change -u to toggle switch

2005-02-13  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* used cz's  ncks --compiler flag to grab compiler info
	* hires timer & udp reporting work on aix with perl >= 5.6.1

2005-02-13  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* added hires timing to test script bld/nco_tst.pl
	* using udpserver2 collector modified from tacg project
	* added udp reporting   "
	* more debugging for    "
	* cleaned up and strictified code
	
2005-02-10  Harry Mangalam  <hjm@tacgi.com>

	* added the getopt & usage section to test script bld/nco_tst.pl
	* added the logging and more debug

2005-02-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added --cmp, --compiler switch to ncks to report compiler name
	with new function nco_cmp_get()

2005-02-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Polished up ncap intrinsic math function definition examples

2005-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added -DABORT_ON_ERROR to Makefile.am for libnco_c++ only

2005-01-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncks prints units, when present, by default (-u now turns this off)

2005-01-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make ncks -q switch a true quiet switch that stops all printing
	to screen. Make new -Q switch handle old -q job. 
	Make ncks -R automatically invoke -q so that remote files may
	be downloaded without attempting to print them.

	* Remove -Wmissing-prototypes from g++ options

	* Fixed g++-3.4.2 prototype warnings with nco_c++

	* Added return to about five void functions to squelch erroneous
	gcc-3.4.2 warnings (and hopefully allow enable-custom-* to work) 

2004-11-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated config.guess to timestamp 20040611

	* Updated config.sub to timestamp 20040312

2004-11-05  Charlie Zender <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Use S_IFLNK instead of S_ISLNK for NEC SX in nco_fl_utl.c

	* Change test -e to more restrictive test -f in configure.in.
	Makes sense and allows NEC SX to build.

	* Add docs on how to build NCO >= 3.0.0 with netCDF < 3.6 to homepage

	* Change so ncks in.nc out.nc does not print global metadata

2004-10-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add -Z, --64-bit-offset switch for FORCE_64BIT_FST mode

	* Prevent printing global metadata on ncks file copies

2004-10-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Put in commented version of netCDF 64-bit file format support

	* Added 32-bit/64-bit distinction discussion to LFS support

2004-09-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove extra carriage returns from ncks global metadata printing
	in nco_prn_att()

	* Declare nco_pck_map as shared in OpenMP loop

2004-09-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncks: Print data to screen when only input file is specified

	* Add NC_BYTE to types of variables with known ndrv in nco_var_pck()

2004-09-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_9
	Changes since nco-2_9_8: 1. ncbo threading 2. ncpdq -P packing

	* Fix problems with building --enable-*-custom

	* Fully merge packing policy/map decisions into nco_var_lst_dvd()
	This should mean that fix/prc distinction is fully integrated

2004-09-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finish packing map documentation. Ready to release.

	* Cause ncpdq in.nc out.nc to default to pck_plc=all_new rather
	than aborting

	* Re-arrange debugging info verbosity levels to be sane

	* Fix erroneous triggering of PURE_MSS_VAL_FLD in nco_var_pck()

2004-09-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified that all packing except NC_XXX->NC_CHAR works pretty well

	* Add new nco_pck_map types hgh_byt and flt_byt to nco_pck_plc_typ_get()

	* Showed packing three_dmn_var_dbl to NC_BYTE works better than
	packing to NC_CHAR

	* Verified packing/unpacking for: NC_INT->NC_SHORT,
	NC_DOUBLE->NC_INT, NC_DOUBLE->NC_BYTE, NC_INT->NC_BYTE,
	NC_SHORT->NC_BYTE, 

	* Allow add_offset, scale_factor to be any type but NC_BYTE and
	NC_CHAR in nco_pck_dsk_inq(). This fixes NC_INT->NC_SHORT unpacking.

	* Learned that NC_INT->NC_SHORT does not work. 
	Presumably all non-floating point packing is suspect until verified

	* Verified each pack map works without memory problems for all_new policy

	* Allow packing to NC_INT in nco_var_pck()

	* Successfully segregated var_fix from var_prc

	* Change nco_pck_typ to nco_pck_plc for "Packing Policy"

	* Incorporated packing policy decisions in nco_var_lst_dvd() to
	segregate var_fix from var_prc. Still not working but
	infrastructure in place.

	* Deprecated nco_is_packable() in favor of more flexible
	nco_pck_plc_typ_get() which accounts for policy desired by nco_pck_map

	* Eliminated all memory problems in ncpdq 
	Verified no excess large blocks remain at program end
	Valgrind rules!

	* Update missing value in nco_var_upk_swp()

	* Handle all nco_pck_typ cases in nco_var_dfn() and end clause of ncpdq

	* Remove dangling pointer from ncpdq all_xst clause

	* Update ncpdq man page. Document -M most everywhere.

	* Create nco_pck_map_get() to parse nco_pck_map arguments to ncpdq -M option

	* Introduce nco_pck_map to nco_typ_pck_get() 
	Only default type nco_pck_map_hgh_sht currently works

	* Move high level packing routines from ncpdq.c to nco_pck.c

	* Finished initial ncpdq packing documentation

	* Verified unpacking complete missing values works, with both scalars and arrays

	* Fixed packing pure missing values fields in nco_var_pck()

	* Replaced duplicated noisy text branches in packing routines with
	ugly goto's and single blocks of code

	* Add ncpdq packing/unpacking test to nco_tst.pl

	* Fix unpacking variables with only add_offset in nco_pck_dsk_inq()

2004-09-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Do not attempt unpacking unless variable already packed

	* Replace USE_EXISTING_PCK in nco_var_pck() with PCK_VAR_WITH_NEW_PCK_ATT

	* Implement synonyms ncpack, ncunpack, and option -U and xst_new

	* More robust handling of cases when only one packing attribute	defined

	* Cast missing_value to double before double comparisons in nco_var_pck()

2004-09-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* NULLify dangling pointer to Fix double-free()'d value buffer problem

2004-09-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finished implementing packing types: all_new, all_xst, upk 

2004-09-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Worked on re-packing already packed variables. Almost working.

2004-08-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added nco.css contributed by Alper Ersoy of the TeXInfo project
	Does not quite work yet, but points the right direction for XML compatibility

2004-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Include sys/types.h prior to regex.h on Mac OS X

2004-08-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncpdq all_new packing seems to work. Next need to get unpacking working.

	* Alter nco_var_dfn() to define dummy scale_factor, add_offset for ncpdq

2004-08-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cleanly segregate pack from re-order functionality in ncpdq
	Assume both are not performed in same ncpdq invocation

	* Pass nco_pck_typ from all operators to nco_var_lst_dvd()

2004-08-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Create nco_pck_mtd() to off-load metadata manipulation

2004-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Copy packing infrastructure from ncra to ncpdq

	* Finished thr_nbr documentation

	* Threaded main variable loop of ncbo

2004-08-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed some formats from %e to %g in nco_tst.pl so that Solaris
	cc executables will pass tests

2004-08-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added first ncatted test to nco_tst.pl

	* Added lots more yummy ncpdq documentation

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_8
	Changes since nco-2_9_7: 1. ncpdq, 2. ncwa --msk_sng consolidated
	mask switch, and 3. C99 

	* Fixed bug where nco_var_dmn_rdr_mtd() returned before reversal
	flag list created for 1-D arrays. This cause reversal of 1-D
	arrays to fail (do nothing).

	* Made valiant stab at ncpdq documentation. Ran out of steam.

2004-08-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* split ncpdq var list into var_fix and var_prc like in ncwa
	All tests appear to work

	* Fixed last known ncpdq problem caused by indexing var_prc_out
	list with var_out index 

	* Added duplicate dimension flag has_dpl_dmn to var_sct

	* Handling situations where re-order list caused non-record
	variables to become record variables was completely broken.
	Inserted mucho logic which implements new policies:
	1. First record variable change request is honored
	2. All subsequent requests are ignored and produce warnings

2004-08-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix ncpdq bug where record coordinate matching was done with
	strstr() instead of strcmp()

	* Fix ncpdq dimension reversal list processing

	* Make all error exits go through nco_err_exit() so that error
	exits uniformly call exit(EXIT_FAILURE) or abort()

	* Fixed diagnostic bug in nco_var_dfn() which would dump core when dbg_lvl=3
	and prg=ncwa

	* Fix ncwa bug introduced in nco_var_dmn() last week.
	nco_tst.pl completes successfully again.

	* Improved/updated man_end.txt and catenated onto end of all man pages

	* Wrote ncap man page ncap.1

	* Added ncpdq.1 man page
	View with nroff -man ~/nco/man/ncpdq.1

2004-08-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented dimension reversal with negative signs in ncpdq

	* Changed dimension re-order switch from -z to -a like ncwa

	* Fixed NCO-wide bug where I used strstr(sng1,sng2) as boolean
	instead of !strcmp(sng1,sng2) 
	This bug occurred in:
	nco_var_cnf_dmn() three times
	nco_var_stretch() three times
	ncbo.c() once time
	When used as a boolean strstr(sng1,sng2) is approximately
	interchangeable with !strcmp(sng1,sng2). 
	Exceptions occur where sng1 is a substring of sng2, in which case
	the dimensions would be different but strstr() would return a match.
	In all locations, the bug appears to have caused extra work, or to
	have incorrectly allowed the above exception where one dimension
	is a substring of another, but in no location does the bug appear
	to have caused wrong answers.

2004-07-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Eliminate ostensibly wrong memmove() in ncwa/ncpdq avg/rdr list processing

	* Rewrote appropriate ncpdq routines to handles record dimension
	re-definitions correctly 

2004-07-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Broke nco_var_dmn_rdr() into two sequential functions
	nco_var_dmn_rdr_mtd() for metadata and nco_var_dmn_rdr_val() for
	values. Calling routine (ncpdq) now holds required intermediate
	information in dmn_idx_out_in.

	* Implement -DNCO_ABORT_ON_ERROR in nco_err_exit() so developers
	can perform easy tracebacks

        * Add AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION(-D_BSD_SOURCE) so default build works

	* Added ncpdq to autoconf build machinery

	* Finish first theoretically working version of ncpdq. 
	Of course, it crashes.

2004-07-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merge ncwa dmn_avg list handling into ncpdq for dmn_rdr

	* Removed un-used dimension nbr_dmn_avg == 0 branch from ncwa

2004-07-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncpdq now copies files perfectly, just like ncks
	No re-order routines have been turned on---that is next
	Tagged this ncpdq version (1.1) with
	ncpdq_perfect_do_nothing_template
	User ncpdq.c version 1.1 as template for future new operators

	* Require default clauses for switch(prg_id)

	* Created ncpdq.c from stripped version of ncwa.c

2004-07-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Installed hooks to call nco_var_dmn_rdr() in ncks
	May need to create new operator to use this capability

	* Added skeleton nco_prs_rdr_lst()

	* First complete draft of nco_var_dmn_rdr() compiles warning-free

2004-07-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement infrastructure for dimension re-ordering routine
	nco_var_dmn_rdr() 

2004-07-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Create nco_bnch.sh to benchmark big file operations

	* Implement preprocessor method in nco.h to disable restrict

	* big.nc "restrict" test with yields incorrect answers with AIX xlc
	
	* Implement restrict in nco_var_cnf_dmn()

	* Change default xlc from -qlanglvl=extended to -qlanglvl=extc99
	to support C99 features like restrict. This does not seem to
	bother xlC, which appears to ignore the -qlanglvl=extc99 switch.

	* Implement restricted pointers throughout arithemetic routines

	* Introduced restrict type qualifier into pointer unions

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_7_pre_restrict
	Last tag prior to implementing C99 features

	* const'ify arithmetic counters used only for normalization

	* Standardized arithmetic prototypes in preparation for implementing
	restricted pointers

2004-07-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco.texi: Correct mix-up of -T and -t options in documentation

2004-07-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_7
	Changes since nco-2_9_6: Read MFO input files from stdin, add 
	more attribute functionality to nco_c++, turn threading on in ncra

	* Updated Makefile to use sophisticated make depends rules that
	handle plusses and slashes in filenames better

	* Added libtest, libtst targets to Makefile

	* Change from C++ to CXX in Makefile

	* Finished replacing %zu's with %lu's with casts to (unsigned long)

	* Provide definitions of fabsf(), sqrtf() in nco_var_rth.c from
	nco_flt_rth.h rather than from special #ifdefs 

2004-07-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed some %zu's back to %lu's with (unsigned long) casting
	Will I have to do this everywhere since %zu is non-ISO?

2004-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add undocumented -Y, --pseudonym, or --prg_nm switch to ncra
	to force it to behave as ncea or ncrcat

2004-07-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change default from OMP=N to OMP=Y in old Makefile

2004-07-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed configure.eg to enable OpenMP on AIX. 'make' and 'make
	install' now work but 'make test' fails with zillions of linker errors: 

        rtld: 0712-001 Symbol omp_get_num_threads was referenced
        from module /u/zender/nco/src/nco/.libs/libnco.so(), but a runtime definition
        of the symbol was not found.

	* AIX xlc does not activate OpenMP unless -qsmp=omp argument used

	* Fixed AIX xlc_r compiler pragma warnings by removing
	/usr/vacpp/include from CPPPATH in configure.eg.
	I think nco_c++ used to need this to find <valarray>, but that no
	longer seems to be the case. Simpler is better.

	* Improve LFS test in big.cdl. 
	Created version that creates large files (> 4 GB) on small-RAM 
	(< 4 GB) systems, and NCO seem OK to deal with resulting files. 

	* Added $dbg_lvl variable to print nco_tst.pl tests during execution

	* Fixed nco_tst.pl test hanging while waiting for interactive
	response to overwrite query

	* Fix brokenness in nco_fl_utl:nco_fl_lst_mk() which triggered
	segfaults in non-multi-file-operators when no input filename was
	offerred, i.e., when there were no positional arguments

	* Fix brokenness in nco_tst.pl caused by renaming -o to -T

	* Changed old (only since 2.9.6) ncwa -t to ncwa -T so can use -t
	for threads consistently everywhere

	* Pass thr_nbr on command line

	* Added LFS stub to nco.texi, pass LFS info from configure.in

	* Added large file support LFS to custom Makefiles. Rorik added it
	to autoconf. 

2004-06-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add nco_openmp_thread_number global attribute to threaded
	programs if HISTORY_APPEND is true

	* nco_openmp_ini() is now mandatory for any program using OpenMP

	* Fixed "variable "_iob" has undefined data scope"
	compiler warnings by passing stdout/stderr filehandles as local
	variables scoped shared in OpenMP parallel clauses

2004-06-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Update OpenMP directives in ncra in preparation for adding
	robust OpenMP diagnostics

2004-06-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove configure.in AC_CHECK_LIB check for cosf() in libC.a. 
	NCO used to get the float functions from this library but it turns
	out that all of these system-supplied float functions are broken
	on AIX. NCO now uses it's own version of these functions.
	Fixes TODO ncap57.
	
2004-06-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ln() as synonym for log() in ncap

	* Fix size_t format printing in memory allocation routines

2004-06-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Never solved problem with reading o/a/e response after using
	stdin for filenames.

2004-06-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Reworked stdin to avoid mixing string and character input.
	  Interactive responses to "overwrite (o/a/e)?" questions must now be
	  terminated with carriage return (and are case-insensitive)

	* Add nco_put_att<int,short,long> functions

	* Add nco_fl_info_get() to nco_fl_mk_lcl()

	* Add readfile, realpath, canonicalize_file_name to AC_CHECK_FUNCS

2004-06-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added new -H section to documentation

	* Change FORTRAN_STYLE to FORTRAN_IDX_CNV

2004-06-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added nco_fl_lst_att_cat() to add input file list global attribute

	* nco_fl_ls_mk() reads input file list from stdin when appropriate
	for multi-file operators. 
	For some reason it no longer pauses for manual stdin, however.

2004-06-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed numerous errors in xargs example

	* Change nco_lib_tst.c to libnco_tst.c and add libnco_c++_tst.cc

2004-06-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Check for strdup() and strcasecmp() with NCO_CHECK_FUNCS rather
	than AC_CHECK_FUNCS so they are protected by NEED_* rather than
	HAVE_* tokens. This improves portability of libnco by reducing
	number of tokens non-NCO programs need to define in order to link
	to libnco.a. This make nco_lib_tst simpler.

	* Add bld/nco_lib_tst.c to test libnco offline

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_6
	Changes since nco-2_9_5: Add -o fl_out option, change ncwa -o
	meaning, AMD64 build tweaks

2004-06-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move old ncwa -o switch to -t, add synonyms --truth_condition,
	--msk_cmp_typ, delete old synonyms --op_cmp, --compare, --cmp.

	* Change warning size for large filenames from 80 to 255 characters

	* Modify nco_fl_lst_mk() so operators accept output filename
	specified with -o (or --fl_out or --output), or as last positional
	argument (traditional behavior). Finished TODO#58.

2004-06-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added demonstration script to handle large numbers of input
	files to nco.texi

2004-06-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement -m64 option for ABI=64 on LINUXAMD64

2004-06-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_5
	Changes since nco-2_9_4: ncflint interpolation is commutative,
	libnco_c++ *.hh headers installed

	* Install libnco_c++ *.hh headers in include directory.

	* Explicitly restrict license of libnco_c++.h to GPL version 2

	* Change behavior of ncflint and nco_var_add_tll_ncflint() to
	return missing_value when either input is missing

2004-06-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco.texi: Documented funny ncflint behavior when one variable is missing 

	* Implement nco_mss_val_cnf() in ncflint to handle corner cases
	where same variable has different missing values in each file

2004-05-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Print shared/static configuration with -r

	* Support newer AC_INIT syntax

	* Default configure.in AIX GCC ABI is 64-bit with -maix64
	Fixes TODO bld31.

2004-05-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_4
	Changes since nco-2_9_3: ncecat works on pure scalar files

	* Allow AIX builds with GCC in bld/Makefile

	* Rearranged nco_tst.pl, added ncecat test, activated ncbo,
	ncea, ncflint tests. Fixes TODO nco332.

2004-05-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Patched ncecat to address scalar file concatenation problem
	Fixes TODO nco331.

	* Set rec_dmn->is_rec_dmn=True; in ncecat.c
	This appears to have been a bug that never triggered any failures

2004-05-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move blurb from nmn_get to last info message

2004-05-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement AMD64 pgcc/pgCC support in build mechanism

2004-05-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	GCC 3.1.1 for x86-64

        * Put CEWI's in nco_lmt.c to allow builds with GCC and
	--enable-*-custom when UDUnits not installed 

2004-04-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_3
	Changes since nco-2_9_2: ncra/ncea arithmetic works when
	missing_value equals zero or any intermediate sum

	* Closed bugs nco121 and nco325

	* Segregate nco_var_add_tll() into nco_var_add_ncra() (which
	checks only current record against missing_value) and
	nco_var_add_ncflint() (which checks both arguments against
	missing_value). This fixes bug where record averages were zero
	when missing_value=0.0.

	* Switch argument order in nco_opr_drv() for clarity/consistency

2004-04-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated News & Announcements section

2004-03-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_2
	Changes since nco-2_9_1: Fix S/V, S%V, S^V, workaround broken
	UDUnits installations

	* Correctly implement non-commutative ncap S%V modulo

	* Correctly implement non-commutative ncap S^V empowerment

	* Document promotion for empowerment (sounds more political than

2004-03-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Correctly implement non-commutative ncap S/V division

2004-03-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify Solaris does autobuild correctly with up-to-date bison 
	and when UDUnits workaround is installed.
	
2004-03-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Re-do UDUnits logic in configure.in to ignore broken UDUnits

	Link to -lC on AIX instead of -lstdc++ as on Linux

2004-03-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_1
	Changes since nco-2_9_0: prp_sei, fix packing bug with ncwa

2004-02-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Described pending NCO proposals in NUG

	* Described how to donate in NCO User's Guide (NUG)

	* Added/explained OPeNDAP vs. DODS in documentation

	* Rorik modified nco_cnf_typ.c: nco_typ_cnv_rth() to fix bug with 
	arithmetic on packed data in ncwa. Probably fixed same bug with
	other artithmetic operators (besides ncap) as well.

2004-02-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_9_0
	Changes since nco-2_8_8: CF convention, ncap corner cases,
	Deactivate non-ANSI __GNUC__ extensions, make check nco_c++

	* Implement CEWI workarounds so tst.cc builds warning-free and
	make check works again with --enable-*-custom

	* Deactivate __GNUC__ extensions for rank reduction in nco_var_avg.c
	Replace #ifndef __GNUC__ with #define FXM_NCO315 1; #ifdef FXM_NCO315
	Will change back to original code only when stack memory problem
	is fully understood/solved/benchmarked to improve on ANSI code branch
	
2004-02-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make Convention CF-1.0 behave same as existing CSM convention

2004-02-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make TODO list easier to understand to facilitate contributions

	* Systematically "symmetrize" all ncap arithmetic operations so
	var OP var, var OP scv, and scv OP var are handled for all operations. 

	* ncap handles var % scv, scv % var

	* ncap handles scv / var

	* Add nco_var_var_pwr() and nco_var_pwr() functions to allow
	empowerment of two variables = var_1^var_2 and scv^var

	* Change CSM to CCSM most everywhere

2004-01-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_8_8
	Changes since nco-2_8_7: --enable-[optimize/debug]-custom works
	again 

	* Remove -fshort-enums from GCC switches as per Rorik. 
	It breaks ABI and caused mysterious failures because libnetcdf.a
	must be compiled with same size enums as NCO apparently.

2004-01-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implement DODS 3.4 switches as default in bld/Makefile

2004-01-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Use valgrind 2.1 to identify and fix small leaks: 
	Free prg_nm in nco_exit_gracefully()

2004-01-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* nco_netcdf.c: Do not initialize rcd unless not doing so might cause CEWI

2004-01-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change dods.sh from RC6 to 3.4 final, and pre-clean

	* Correct documentation of covariance procedure

2004-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change AIX xlC enable-optimized-debug from -O5 to -O3 so shared
	libraries work again

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_8_7
	Changes since nco-2_8_6: Default GCC builds work again,
 	ncap packing works again

	* Fix GCC compiles when enable-*-custom	is not specified. This
	should fix reported Cygwin build problem. 

	* nco_pck() uses tally-free arithmetic. Fixes ncap packing
	bug introduced in 2.8.4.

2004-01-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Only manually prototype lexer function in ncap_lex.l if
	enable-*-custom build option specified with GCC.
	Fixes build problems with cygwin 

	* Document make install-strip in doc/README as per Rorik

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_8_6
	Changes since nco-2_8_5: Add -Werror to GCC compiles, fix AIX and
	SGI builds

	* Wrap new ncap_lex.l content in ifdef __GNUC__ since breaks on
	AIX, SGI. AIX and SGI now build again.

2004-01-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* NCO compiles warning free again so add -Werror to GCC custom flags

	* Add and elaborately comment on multiple yylex() prototypes
	required to build ncap warning-free with pedantic debugging flags.

	* Use correct token, NCO_MSA_H, instead of NCO_VAR_UTL_H, in nco_msa.h
	This fixes all remaining implicit function declaration warnings
	Until now, no routines in nco_msa.c had prototypes known outside
	of that file unit. Unlikely that this caused problems since no
	known casts were employed in prototypes. This demonstrates the
	usefulness of -Werror. Without it, this bug would still be there.
	
2004-01-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Conjoin setting GCC flags in configure.in, avoid duplication

	* Systematize header file names

	* Improved dods.sh documentation

	* Moved system headers from nco_lmt.c to nco_lmt.h

2004-01-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Give DODS example in -R documentation

	* Add -R to correct -R examples in documentation 

2004-01-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	of nc_put_varm_float() 

	* Replace nco_netcdf.h prototypes with type-safe const'ified prototypes

2004-01-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Use sqrtf() where appropriate

	* Preserve const'ness of string literal assignments and returns

	* Use trigraph return in qsort() comparison functions nco_cmp_*()
	to completely avoid arithmetic and overflows

2004-01-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Improve qsort() comparison functions nco_cmp_*() based on
	responses to comp.lang.c thread 20040101:
	1. Avoid overflow conditions by not performing subtraction
	2. Preserve const-ness by using comparison rather than using 
	casting and subtraction
	
2003-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* De-lint code with --enable-debug-custom
	Fixed sloppy casts, signed/unsigned comparisons, missing const's
	in nearly all source code.

	* make dst_cln cleans volatile autotools build files in root directory

	* Add top-level file descriptions to MANIFEST

	* Expand GNU triplet names to specific architectures tested (i.e.,
	use more restrictive triplets)

	* Add correct compiler and OS criteria for custom compiler switches

	consistent among all operators. Documented this in nco.texi.

2003-07-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Removed FTP requirement from make tst. Create nco_tst.sh creates
	foo.nc from scratch without needing to FTP nco_tst.nc. 
	Test involving FTP is now called make tst_ftp.

2003-07-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_7_4

	where malloc() ENOMEM errors are handled directly by the calling
	code for additional diagnostics.

2003-05-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move RPM-wishlist off high-priority list, add restrictive MSA
	parsing to list as per Shultz request

	obsolete by Henry's MSA printing algorithm.

2003-03-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* General honing of nco.texi

	* Implemented TeX and TeXInfo macros to keep math variables
	consistent with LaTeX sources. Mostly successful, except Info
	does not like macros inside or macros, e.g., @var{@wndznl{}}

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_7_2
	Changes since nco-2_7_1: disk-based, MSA printing indices work

2003-03-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replaced examples in nco.texi with output from MSA printing

2003-03-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Modifying debian/* files to build with 2.7.x as zender

2003-03-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove -ansi flag from gcc builds because it is (apparently)
	equivalent to -std=c89 and thus conflicts with -std=c99.

2003-03-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Began Debian-ization of upstream source by populating debian
	directory with nco-2.2.0 Debian package files by Brian Mays
	NB: Files in debian/ are for 2.2.0 (i.e., way out of date)
	We are trying to Debian-ize upstream source for NCO ~2.8.0
	Expect some hiccups when that finally happens
	
	* Insert LINUXARM in Linux portion of bld/Makefile

	* Synchronize Debian nco/doc/man with CVS nco/man

	* Add Debian files by Brian Mays to CVS repository:
 	debian: changelog control convert copyright postinst prerm rules

        * Documented procedure for computing covariance of two variables
	using http://jisao.washington.edu/data/nco/ as template 

2003-01-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_7_1
	Changes since nco-2_7_0: long options on all platforms, packing
	fix for ncap

	* Initiate HPPA support in bld/Makefile

2003-01-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

2003-01-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Rorik added conditional compilation of Sittler's getopt_long() 
	where necessary, removed *_GETOPT_LONG tokens from all source code.

2003-01-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Successfully built NCO 2.7.0 on Redhat 8.0 at HP Testdrive site
	spe141.testdrive.compaq.com. The HP Testdrive site has virtually
	every imaginable combination of hardware and OS, so now NCO may
	be tested on all of these machines. My first test with a new
	architecture, HP-UX (HPPA), failed because of lack of C++
	compiler. Thus Testdrive computers do not appear to be fully
	loaded with reliable compilers. 

2003-01-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_7_0
	Changes since nco-2_6_6: long options and multislabbing

2002-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add rudimentary tests of multislabbing to nco_tst.sh

	* Clean up nco_msa.[ch]. Still need to fix void * arithmetic

2002-12-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Moved multi-slabbing algorithm to nco_msa.[ch]

2002-12-19  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	 * First version of multi-hyperslabbing along a single dimension
	 for ncks
	
2002-12-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Took advantage of NEED_FNC to remove MACOSX kludge in nco_rth_flt.h

	* Merged Rorik's long options mods

2002-11-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Restore ./configure file from 2.6.5 and re-tag as 2.6.6

2002-10-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_6
	Changes since nco-2_6_5: ncrename fixes, ncap type conversion

	* Use '.' consistently in .var@.att renaming

	* Changed variable-attribute delimiter in ncrename from ":" to "@"
	to be consistent with ncap

	* Fixed ncrename to not fail when . specified and variable does
	not contain attribute

2002-09-24  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	* Added type conversion functions for attributes and variables
	  byte, char, short, int, float, and double

2002-09-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* info-friendly changes to nco.texi

2002-09-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_5
	Changes since nco-2_6_4: CRAY and SUN builds

	* Fix SunOS builds in bld/Makefile

2002-09-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Patches from Len Makin for CRAY
	1. Cray patch for ncap symbol table
	2. Makefile fixes for Cray
	3. nco_tst.sh tweaks
	Applied the Makefile flags to configure.in as well
	
2002-09-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_4
	Changes since nco-2_6_3: MACOSX builds, SGI, NEC tweaks

	* Match SX-* with NECSX architecture in pvmgetarch

	* Correct some dependencies for string compatibility functions

	* Adapt for missing <cstdlib> with SGI CC

2002-09-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added esoteric math functions to MACOSX using float<-->double
	coercion method

	* Implement compatibility strdup() and strcasecmp()
	Comeau should now work but have not tested it

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_3
	Changes since nco-2_6_2: 
	Numerous build improvments and removal of PVM_ARCH ifdefs
	MACOSX builds with bld/Makefile, documentation fixes

	* MACOSX builds appear to work

	* Add ranlib to bld/Makefile libnco.a target for MACOSX builds

	* Get rid of inline qualifier on nco_rth_flt function definitions

	* Move function definitions from nco_rth_flt.h to nco_rth_flt.c

	* Verified that bison 1.29 on MACOSX screws up ncap_yacc.y
	translation. Installed bison 1.35 on compile farm MACOSX system,
	and builds work fine.

	* Remove ncap_utl.o from libnco.a

	* #include <math.h> in nco_rth_flt.h

	* Do not look for <getopt.h> in MACOSX

2002-09-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added preliminary MACOSX support to bld/Makefile
	Everything appears to work but ncap, which has numerous problems 
	on MACOSX because of bison, float functions, and ranlib.

	* Code compiles with gcc -ansi -pedantic -D_BSD_SOURCE
	Switches -std=c99 and -std=gnu99 both work too
	-D_BSD_SOURCE tells GCC nameser.h is ANSI-compliant

	* Moved float math function definitions to nco_rth_flt.h,
	created declarations for MACOSX in nco_rth_flt.c

2002-09-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented pre-processor macros CST_X_PTR_CST_PTR_CST_Y,
	X_CST_PTR_CST_PTR_Y to be as const-correct as possible for the
	language the source code is treated as. If treated as C++, full
	const-correct prototypes are implemented, else if treated as C,
	a const is dropped here or there to make things compile
	warning-free. Fixes TODO #213.

2002-09-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up ncap section of nco.texi, polish documentation builds,
	add XML, txt formats from makeinfo

	* Fixed nco.texi problems, generating docs at compile farm

2002-09-03  unknown  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Typecast return value of strdup() to char *

2002-09-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* #include <config.h> in all headers which reference strdup()

	* Crude but workable HAVE_STRCASECMP support, 
	include config.h headers to allow future HAVE_STRDUP handling

	* Implement some Comeau support, but presence of non-ANSI
	functions strdup(), strcasecmp() makes full Comeau support
	unlikely anytime soon

2002-08-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tweak CC list in configure.in, remove c89, xlc_r

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_2
	Changes since nco-2_6_1: 
	Improvements to autotools builds
	Initial ncap handling of user-defined dimensions

	* Replace PVM_ARCH token with HAVE_GETOPT_H for getopt.h handling

	* Remove Fortran files nco_cal_utl.F,  nco_fortran.F,
	nco_fortran.h since it is unlikely anyone will step forward to
	maintain fortran support. Of course these can be resurrected if
	necessary. 

	* Add instructions for using compile farm, modify AIX, MACOSX
	builds 

2002-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Define var_in_typ before using in nco_cnv_mss_val_typ()

	* Began using HAVE_CONFIG_H, config.h in source files (nco_scm.[ch],tst.cc)

2002-08-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_1
	Changes since nco-2_6_0: 
	Unpacking is now supported for all arithmetic operators

	* Improved regression testing in configure.eg

	* Eliminate unnecessary type conversion to typ_dsk in ncra, ncea, ncwa
	This could reduce precision of answers
	Thanks to Martin Dix for pointing this out

2002-08-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_6_0
	Changes since nco-2_5_6: 
	Unpacking support is now beta for all arithmetic operators

	* Print attributes with same formatting as variables

	* Added hooks for packing support in arithmetic operators:
	Code was changed in locations marked with "pck_dbg"
	1. Change type of output in nco_def_var() from var->type to
	var->typ_upk when is_rth_opr() is true
	2. Unpack variable in nco_var_get() when is_rth_opr() is true
	3. nco_att_cpy() does not copy attributes "scale_factor",
	"add_offset" for unpacked output variables
	4. nco_att_cpy() ensures "missing_value" is converted to unpacked
	type before copying
	5. nco_var_get() refreshes var->pck_ram on each read
	6. Use nco_cnv_mss_val_typ() to keep type of missing_value in sync
	Unpacking appears to be working for all arithmetic operators!
	
2002-08-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added .cvsignore to dirs affected by autoconf

	* Added autoconf-specific list to doc/TODO

	* Added configure.eg to keep track of autoconf problems

	* Changed bld/Makefile to work with ncap_lex.l and ncap_yacc.y
	Removed ncap.l and ncap.y.

2002-08-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_6
	Changes since nco-2_5_5: fixed processing of missing_values
	for integer variables in ncra, initial auto build tools

	* Merged Rorik's autobuild infrastructure. New (autobuild) and
	old (bld/Makefile) systems both appear to work but there may
	be some interference on ncap since ncap.l had to be renamed
	ncap_lex.c and ncap.y is ncap_yacc.c.

	* Altered pck_dsk_inq() to set var->typ_upk=var->type by default
	so that nco_cnv_mss_val_typ_upk() has something to work with

	* Fixed problem in nco_cnf_typ.c which caused failure for ncra
	when variable had missing_value attribute and needed to be
	promoted before arithmetic (e.g., int to float). Freeing variable
	each record but leaving mss_val the promoted type resulted in 
	mss_val being overwritten (usually to value of 0.0) in all
	records but first for each file. Problem was ncra-specific and
	is described in more detail in header of nco_cnv_mss_val_typ_upk()
	routine. Better fix would be to carry type of missing_value as
	separate element of var structure.

2002-08-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_5
	Changes since nco-2_5_4: Global "history" attribute fix
	
	* Fix bug in nco_hst_att_cat() introduced in 2.4.2 which left
	att_nm undefined when global history attribute did not exist

2002-08-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_4
	Changes since nco-2_5_3: NECSX support
	
	* Extensive support for NECSX architecture contributed by 
	Len Makin <len at hpc.csiro.au>

2002-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make Rorik Peterson a developer. Add sourceforge logo to homepage.

2002-07-28    <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated to cygwin-gcc-3.1.1-4 and build problems appear to have
	gone away, but syslimits.h is still not found so GSL cannot build

2002-07-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Correct ncap symbol table to build on SGI6, SGI64 platforms

	* Add ncap to nco_tst.sh test suite

2002-07-08    <zender@LANINA>

	* All operators build with cygwin gcc-3.1.1 as long as
	-I/usr/include is given first (fixes weird syslimits.h problem),
	non-kludge fix may require updated gcc and mingw packages.

	* Modify Makefile for cygwin-1.3.x compatibility.
	Everything appears to build except ncap.l/ncap_lex.c which needs
	syslimits.h which current cygwin gcc-3.1.1 does not appear to support

2002-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_2

	* conditionally added acosh, asinh, atanh, cosh, sinh, tanh to ncap

	* unconditionally added floor(), ceil() to ncap

	* Print double precision numbers with 12 digits of precision

	* conditionally added erf(), erfc() to ncap

	* Document ncks -b, -B switches in manual

	* Fix size of extracted dimension list for wgt and var calls to
	nco_var_fll(). Print error and hint when encountering TODO #111
	problems rather than dumping core.

2002-07-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_1

	* Modified ncatted to delete all attributes for specified variable
	when no specific attribute name is given for that variable.

2002-06-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_5_0

	* Added man pages for NCO operators to man directory.
	Source of man pages is Debian distribution by Brian Mays,
	which automatically generates man pages from texinfo source.
	Thus man pages are moderately out of date, currently for version 2.2.0. 

2002-06-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make namespace safe by prefixing all functions with nco_ or ncap_

2002-06-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_6
	* Changes since nco-2_4_5: Sorting routines

	* Replace indexx* routines with system qsort()-based routines

2002-06-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Lexer/parser changes to implement conditional, clean up rx's

2002-06-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_5
	* Changes since nco-2_4_4: Arithmetic routines use const.
	More warning messages during compilation due to size_t printf

	* Fixed bug where mss_val_sht was dereferenced into long
	in one arithmetic routine.

	* Made as many parts of arithmetic routines const as possible
	and implemented const instantiaion outside of loops to reduce
	dereferencing wherever possible.
	If NCO suddenly seems faster, this is why.

2002-06-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noticed that GCC gives warnings when printf'ing size_t with %lu
	format flag since type of size_t is non-portable. GNU offers
	non-portable %z workaround. Recommended solution is to typecast
	all size_t's to unsigned longs before printf'ing.

	* Worked on 64-bit clean issues identified by AIX -qwarn64 flag
	The only possible non-functioning code found was date conversion
	code which could break on YYYYMMDD dates.
	Converted int's to longs where necessary to solve this.
	Used size_t instead of int or long where possible.
	Used ptrdiff_t instead of int where warranted.
	Most of remaining warnings could be solved by using size_t instead
	of int or long for counters, but mismatches are unavoidable at
	some point since type nco_long variables (i.e., netCDF data) 
	needs to interact with size_t variables on occasion.
	
	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_4
	* Changes since nco-2_4_3: Build system

2002-06-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Allow 64 bit mode ABI (addresses are all 64 bits) on AIX
	when compiled with ABI=64.
	This should allow NCO to work on files larger than 2--4 GB
	The default for SGI was already 64 bits.

2002-06-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Make flex/bison default on AIX

2002-05-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_3
	Changes since nco-2_4_2: History attribute handling

	* Added target non_ncap to Makefile in attempt to prevent NCAR AIX breakage

	* Fixed hst_att_cat() to handle non-standard "History" attribute
	same as standard "history" attribute

2002-05-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_2
	Changes since nco-2_4_1: #include file mechanism works,
	AT&T lex-compatibility broken by using flex <EOF> rules

	* Documented ncap file insertion

	* Fixed #including file mechanism, generalized line counting and
	file name storage

2002-05-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Realized that AIX lex does not support <EOF> like flex

	* Ported to NPACI environment

2002-05-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_1
	Changes since nco-2_4_0: minor bugfix which should fix
	use of operators in scripts where return code is checked

2002-05-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More ncap work to prepare for dimension list structures
	which are going to be implemented correctly by tokenizing
	each element of dimension list and assembling full list in
	parser and letting scanner pass in each token. 

2002-05-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added nco_op_typ element to prs_sct for handling dimension
	reduction functions

2002-05-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Fixed bug where nco_exit always returned EXIT_FAILURE

2002-05-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added skeleton code to read #include'd files. Not yet working.

2002-05-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_4_0
	Changes since nco-2_3_1: Builds out of box on all Unices
	
	* Surround fabsf and fmodf prototypes with ifndef __GNUG__
	since g++ linking fails when prototypes explicitly specified
	in header _and_ in function. This is a kludge to a kludge
	to enable full g++ compilation.

	* Version now builds on AIX (even ncap.y with pure_parser)
	as long as cc compiler, not xlc or xlC, is used. Prototype
	warnings similar to gcc prototype warnings can be ignored.
	All major platforms are once again working out of the box.
	
2002-05-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_3_1
	Changes since nco-2_3_0: New design, same functionality
	Appears to work on Linux, IRIX but compile problems on AIX

	* gcc compiles with spurious errors but links and tests fine

	* g++ compiles fine but unable to link with fabsf fmodf

	* Code builds and test correctly when compiled with icc

	* New code compiles completely warning-free with icc 6.0

2002-05-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ability to write unformatted binary output to
	ncks using -B switch. Seems to work

2002-05-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_3_0
	Changes since nco-2_2_4: Completely unstable version with
	new modular design. Library does build cleanly.

	* Redesigned libnco.a as modular library
	Split into ~20 smaller source files each with private header
	Used const wherever possible

2002-04-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finished name cleanup in ncap. Still need to break large
	files into smaller granules and const'ify prototypes

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_2_4
	Changes since nco-2_2_3: Packing and unpacking functions now
	both work in ncap

	* Reducing ndrv number of discretely representable values by
	1 appears to fix the rounding problems. Will probably have to
	reduce it by one more to make room for a missing value.

2002-04-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Packing appears to be working, but not recursively, and there
	are still issues of speed and rounding problems

	* Automatically call var_upk() in var_get() in ncap only

	* Improved pck/upk values in in.cdl

	* Make var_pck() alter typ_pck, typ_upk elements when finished
	packing

2002-04-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Put warnings on some arbitrary limits in ncap

	* Modify ncap and Makefile to link to -lC AIX C++ library to
	access float intrinsics cosf()... AIX does not support gammaf()
	(nor does SGI).

2002-04-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_2_3
	Changes since nco-2_2_2: Support unpacking variables in ncap

	* Altered ncap algorithm so that now binary var/att expressions
	take highest precision type rather than always using var type.
	This allows unpacking algorithm to work straightforwarly using
	scale_factor and add_offset convention.

2002-04-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_2_2
	Changes since nco-2_2_1: fix rare ncwa weight bug 

	* make tst gets test file from dust.ps.uci.edu rather than CGD

	* Avoid wgt portion of ncwa when DO_CONFORM_WGT = False
	This section was superfluous in this situation anyway.
	Avoiding it by testing for DO_CONFORM_WGT appears to fix
	some hard to identify bug when lon was being averaged with gw as
	weight. The two did not conform, but a problem occured anyway.
	This appears to cure the three mysterious ncwa crashes present in
	the TODO list so mark those as fixed too.

2002-04-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Switch back to using pure_parser to prevent Linux core dumps on 

2002-03-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Prototype fabsf() where used to help Sun compilation

2002-03-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Quiet output by only printing CONVENTION when dbg > 0

2002-03-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove %pure_parser from ncap.y to preserve yacc compatibility

2002-02-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Described LHS casting in manual

2002-02-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* ncap variable division had numerator and denominator swapped!

	* Removed ncap_lex.c ncap.tab.c ncap.tab.h because they are not
	portable across platforms so it is best to let these be generated
	on user's machine until portable x-platform versions can be 
	generated. Immediate problem is that IRIX and Linux versions
	are interfering with eachother.

	* ncap -r does not require argument

2002-02-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Began documenting ncap in nco.texi

2002-02-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove ncap dependency on getopt.o, getopt1.o since
	getopt_long() is not currently used (but using it is on 
	the TODO list). Re-implementing getopt_long() will be done
	eventually, but now just make ncap easier to build to facilitate 
	more beta testing.

2002-02-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_2_0:
	Changes since nco-2_1_3: Henry made subscripts lexer tokens and
	improved dimension list handling so LHS casting works regardless
	of precedence or presence of LHS expressions.

	* Small ANSI fixes in ncap.c for AIX

	* Replace math float prototypes required for AIX, Solaris builds
	These are not required on Linux or IRIX, which keep them in math.h

	* Documentation changes

2002-02-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Quieted output by removing verbose printing from debug level = 0
	Execution is now silent except for WARNINGS and INFOs.

2002-01-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added some Compile Farm procedures to nco_src_frg.txt

	* Add FREEBSD support to Makefile, and allow environment
	to override CC and C++ compiler variables

2002-01-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_1_3
	Changes since nco-2_1_2: LHS casting really works as long as
	dimensions are already in output file. Replaced var_add() in ncap,
	no known parser bugs, just missing features. 

	* Created var_add_no_tally() by copying var_subtract() and
	changing minuses to pluses. This routine does not use tally,
	and does handle missing values appropriately.
	Changed ncap_var_var_add() to use var_add_no_tally() rather than
	var_add(). This fixed segfaults with prs_mdp definition,
	which now works as expected.

	* ncap variable addition scripts break in var_add()
	Possibly because not all ncap routines malloc() tally array
	Possibly because missing values handling is not failsafe in
	var_add() (although I believe it is fine for other NCO operators)

	* Allocate tally using sizeof(long) rather than
	nco_typ_lng(NC_INT)

2002-01-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Move LHS_cst cleanup to statement_list rule so cleanup does
	not occur before last expression in statement is evaluated

	* Added ncap_var_stretch() to out_var_exp = att_exp action

	* Spread out debug levels to create more uniform distribution
	of diagnostics as dbg_lvl increases

	* LHS casting is semi-working, semi-broken. Seems to work when all
	required dimensions are already in input file and RHS is variable,
	not attribute. Thus a3[lat,lon,lev] = one works but
	a3[lat,lon,lev]=1.0 does not. 
	Still thinking about how to stretch attributes.

2002-01-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_1_2
	Changes since nco-2_1_1: ncap warning cleanups, icc conformance,
	plug most non-ncap leaks detected by insure++

	* Move yylex() so only called once in ncap_initial_scan()

2002-01-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Use <limits.h> to get INT_MIN, INT_MAX

	* Changed from gcc to icc on Intel, seems to work fine

	* Cast char to unsigned char and visa versa where necessary to
	prevent icc warnings. This solved all icc warnings on ncap, and
	solved all IRIX cc warnings for ncap too. Since unsigned char
	pointer and char pointer are same size, there should be no problem
	casting between them. However, casting between unsigned char value
	and char value could change answers. 
	String operations should be checked to ensure they still work.

2002-01-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix read overflow in ncks.c:prn_var_val_lmt() where
	non-NUL-terminated character array was being printed with %s format

2002-01-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fix non-NUL-terminated strings in hst_att_cat()

	* Added nco/doc/purify.txt to track memory problems reported by purify

2002-01-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Remove templates for math functions from ncap.c

	* Implement CCOMMENT start state to recognize C comments /* */ 

	* Explicitly declare yy_scan_string() to remove compiler warnings

	* Implement/use nco_set_fill() wrapper 
	Remove architecture-dependent wrapper on usage
	Pass pointer to valid fll_md_old since NULL is not safe
	because nc_set_fill() may try to write to it

2002-01-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Initialize RHS to False, add global LHS_cast

2002-01-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Enable assertion macros in ncap

	* Changed Makefile default to OMP=N until further testing

	* Began implementation of lexer for subscripted variables
	with x[dmn1,dmn2,...dmnN] syntax. Currently creates list of 
	dimension structures but does nothing with it.

2002-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified ncap script gives same answers as odxc.ncl script

	* var_free() superceded variable in ncap_var_conform_dim()
	causes core dump (why?), but not free'ing must cause memory leak 

	* Realized var_conform_dim() has bug of omission: does not abort
	when variables do not conform because dimension list of one is
	subset of other but ORDER of dimensions differs, e.g.,
	a(lat,lev,lon) !~ b(lon,lev). 
	NCO probably returns incorrect answers silently in this case!  

2002-01-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added variable/variable division (which had been overlooked)

	* Created ncap_var_stretch() which generalizes var_conform_dim()
	by including convolution of variables. ncap_var_stretch() appears
	to work as drop in replacement for var_conform_dim(). 
	Convolution is just a stub which does not do anything yet.
	Realized that expansion might work by creating arbitrary variable
	of convolution size and then separately calling var_conform_dim()
	with that as var and both vars as wgt.

	* First build of ncap on LINUXALPHA architecture

2001-12-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More ncap.* cleanup. Alter some variable names to conform to
	rest of NCO.

2001-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Succeeded in building ncap on 64 bit machines: SGI, Alpha, Sun
	All of these machines have bison installed
	Some of these builds require building getopt.o separately
	Build fails on IBM because yacc does not understand pure_parser
	
2001-12-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More CEWI initializations

	* Changed copyright to 2002

	* Remove C++ comment characters that crept into various routines
	Using // comments causes default to compilation to break on many
	architectures (Linux being an exception)
	
	* cvs tag -c nco-2_1_1
	Changes since nco-2_1_0: ncap uses @ for attributes
	Mixed rank handling improved but still broken

	* Fix '@' handling for global attributes

	* Make handling of attribute indicator @ consistent in warnings

	* ncap.l: cast void to ptr_aed->type not undefined type

	* Begin clean up of ncap code, eliminate compiler warnings

2001-12-11  Henry Butowsky  <henryb@ntlworld.com>

	* Changed ncap.l so attributes now use the @ symbol rather than :
	          i.e var_nm@att_nm rather than var_nm:att_nm

	* Changed ncap.y So that 1-D variables can be saved in an attribute
	
	* Attempted to fix the rank problem. Added ncap_var_conform_dim() to
	  ncap_utl.c, Its not working correctly at the mo.
	
        * Added att_lst_max to ncap.c
	
	* Updated ncap.in

2001-12-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_1_0
	Changes since nco-2_0_3: ncrename interactive query limiter
	ncap extravaganza

	* Move Henry's tests into ncap.in script

	* Allow global:att_nm to signify global attributes in ncap

	* Removed file query cruft from ncrename and added maximum
	response count short circuit mechanism to prevent batch jobs
	from going bonkers when -O not specified and output file exists

	* Added hybrid coordinate info to in.cdl

2001-11-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added three_dim_var_crd to check COORDS storage convention ordering

2001-10-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed getopt dependencies and included nco_netcdf.h nco.h in
	ncap stuff 

2001-10-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_0_3
	Changes since nco-2_0_2: ncks bugfixes for units printing,
	and version information

	* Use NC_REC_DMN_UNDEFINED instead of -1 where appropriate

	* Fix argument list to nco_inq_varid() call in ncap 

	* Fix netCDF3 migration bug that could cause core dumps because
	non-coordinate dimensions where being interpreted as coordinate
	dimensions in ncks due to changed nature of nc_inq_varid returns

2001-10-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added VERSION infrastructure for recording build information in executable

	* Check rcd before Exit_Gracefully() in main() routines so 
	rcd does not generate "set but not used warnings"

2001-10-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_0_2
	Changes since nco-2_0_1: No user-visible changes
	All changes are in netCDF3 compliant function semantics
	for the nco_netcdf wrappers. Altered many routines to call
	information-specific versions of inquire functions where
	possible.

	* Verified nco-2_0_2 passes test suite 

	* nco_typ_sng(): NC_CHAR is unsigned char, moved nco_typ_sng(),
	c_type_nm(), fortran_typ_nm() to nco_netcdf library so that
	library may take advantage of these routines in printing useful
	diagnostics, yet still be independent of the rest of NCO.

	* Attempted to replace netCDF2-style use of -1 return codes
	by rcd and comparison to NC_NOERR everywhere. This is not exactly
	straightforward because there are many valid reasons to have
	literal constant -1 in the code. I think I did this correctly.
	However the use of -1, instead of NC_GLOBAL, for global attributes
	and, for ncatted, to indicate that attribute changes should apply
	to all variables, should be changed to NC_GLOBAL so code is more clear.

	* Change functions to implement netCDF 3.X interface
	Meaning pass answer holder as pointer and pass back return code
	nco_open(), nco_create(), nco_inq_[var,dim,att]*()

	* ncks.c prn_var_val_lmt(): Handle nco_inq_attid() correctly

2001-10-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Build is clean and successful with g++/Linux, xlC/AIX

	* Return (int)0 instead of (int)NULL from nco_typ_lng()

	* Initialize nc_type variables with new netCDF 3.5 token NC_NAT
	This requires building NCO > 2.0.1 with netCDF >= 3.5
	This change also permits successful builds with g++ again, which
	complained about initializing nc_type with non nc_type enums
	
	* cvs tag -c nco-2_0_1
	Changes since nco-2_0_0:
	Cleaner separation of netCDF wrappers into nco_netcdf.c,.h
	Appearance of error messages slightly changed since prg_nm_get()
	no longer invoked by wrappers

	* ncap uses nco netCDF3 interface

        * Structure nco_netcdf.h as standard library header
        
	* Forbid multiple includes of nco_netcdf.h

        * Changed nc.h to nco.h for namespace consistency

        * Removed prg_nm_get() from all nco wrappers so wrappers have
	no external dependencies

	* Changed nc_err_exit() to nco_err_exit()

	* Removed superfluous headers from nco_netcdf.c

2001-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed storage location of remotely accessible in.nc to
	.../nco/in.nc 

	* Various Makefile changes for exotic NCAR platforms

	* Changed band to bnd in in.cdl

2001-07-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* TODO: Rearranged TODO list and put ~15 high-priority
	items up on the top

2001-05-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added HDF5 interface to nco_create(), using HDF5 preprocessor
	token to isolate native HDF code currently

2001-05-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-2_0_0

	* This netcdf3 branch is now merged into the main trunk.
	The netcdf2 branch is now in maintenance mode.

	* cvs tag -c nco-1_3_4

2001-04-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed to using nco_inq_att_flg() in ncar_csm_inq()

2001-03-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-1_3_3

	* nco_tst.sh runs as expected when compiled with OPTS=D and OPTS=O 
	on both Linux 32 bit and Irix 64 bit

	* Removed make options for NETCDF2_ONLY flag which is no longer
	supported with NCO 1.3 branch

	* Default build now compiles with -DNO_NETCDF_2 flag and tests
	successfully.

	* Replaced nclong with nco_long = long. 
	There's no need to remove nco_long just yet until a long term
	strategy for dealing with long, size_t, int issues is decided
	upon. netCDF 3.x deprecates the whole nclong issue, but it might
	be useful to have reminders of where the issue was important,
	e.g., in the fortran arithmetic routines.

	* Changed in.cdl to use int rather than deprecated long and
	removed deprecated "l", "L" suffices to numeric constants

	* Added i18n headers to ncra.c and to Makefile with default being
	no internationalization. Hooks appear to work fine.

	* Changed NC_LONG to NC_INT to adhere closer to standard. 
	Type NC_LONG is currently synonymous with NC_INT and will continue
	to be represented by native type long.

2001-03-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added Makefile option to disable OpenMP support on compilers
	that automatically support it: OMP=N

2001-03-06  Henry Butowsky  <thin@thin.screaming.net>

        * fixed ncdiff problem. There was a conversion error in dmn_dfn 

	* fixed ncrename problem. There was a typo error
	  in nco_rename_var ( it was calling itself) This
	  is the third such error in nco_netcdf.c. 
	  
2001-03-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Code fails to compile with -DNO_NETCDF_2

	* Code compiles but is buggy. This command fails:
	ncdiff -O -C -v three_dmn_rec_var in.nc in.nc foo.nc;ncks -H foo.nc	
	As does 
	ncdiff -O -C -v PS nco_tst.nc nco_tst.nc foo.nc
	
	* Removed NETCDF2_ONLY code

2001-02-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c nco-1_3_2

	* After many minor tweaks, made commits and retagged nco-1_2_2
	and this is the version that will be merged into 1_3_1 to create
	1_3_2

	* Tagged changes until today as nco-1_3_1 and will merge with
	nco-1_2_2 

2001-02-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Figured out that texi2dvi --pdf really does work nicely and am
	now using it rather than ps2pdf

	* Tagged and released nco-1_2_2

2001-01-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clean up some function prototypes, removed crud from nc.h,
	implemented extern keyword on all functions

	* Changed ncks print formatting of NC_BYTE data (i.e., signed
	char) to print as unsigned char data to facilitate printing
	HDF4 datasets.

2000-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added make NETCDF2=Y to compare netCDF2 behavior with/without
	HDF libraries. HDF libraries cause ncwa to fail certain tests
	that work fine with Unidata netcdf2 libraries. All other operators 
	appear fine with HDF libraries.

	* Added default statements to switch(type) constructs which
	emitted warnings when compiled with -DNETCDF2_ONLY since,
	apparently, there are a whole bunch of things besides numeric
	types in the old nctype enum and gcc warns about enums that are
	not exhaustively considered in switch() statements. 
	All these default statements can be removed with netCDF3 interface
	so perhaps these should be surrounded with #ifdef NETCDF2_ONLY
	constructs, but they actually do make sense for netCDF3 as well
	so I have implemented a uniform error function, dfl_case_nctype_err(), 
        to be called by all routines which emit errors only when compiled with
        NETCDF2_ONLY.
        This makes the behavior easy to modify or remove in the future.

	* Fixed echoing of Makefile diagnostics

	* Added HDF4 option to Makefile to facilitate compiling with HDF
	version of netCDF libraries

2000-11-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added -q ("quiet") switch to ncks to suppress printing of
	dimension indices and coordinate values

2000-11-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Created netcdf3 branch with tag netcdf3 and additional version
	tag nco-1_3. This branch will hold the netcdf3 implmentation while
	it is in development. When it is ready it will become the main
	trunk of nco.

2000-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented new @command{}, @env{}, and @acronym{} keywords in
	nco.texi

2000-10-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed makeinfo problem with nco.texi

2000-10-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented Henry's ncrename and nco_tst patches: Former
	allows renaming of attribute for a single variable, latter cleans
	up nco_tst.sh and allows easier function-specific testing.

2000-10-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Cast results of sqrt() to LHS type to eliminate new gcc 2.96
	warnings. g++ 2.96 is less forgiving than gcc 2.2

	* Fixed some miscast missing values in arithmetic routines for
	doubles, shorts, and longs. Odd that I had not noticed these
	miscasts before. g++ 2.96 flagged them.

2000-09-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed one-line bug where ncwa min,max,ttl cases fell
	through to error exit rather than doing nothing with weights

	* Adding critical regions about netCDF library calls appeared to
	work. ncwa and ncra/ncea now give repeatable, correct answers when
	multithreaded. Speedups appear to be about ~30--40% on small
	numbers of typical GCM files when using 4 threads. Performance
	appears to level out by 4 threads, although more timing is
	necessary. For example, ncwa is now spending about 50% on I/O and
	50% on computation.

2000-09-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added OpenMP critical regions to var_get() and var_refresh()

	* Added OpenMP critical regions around thread-unsafe netCDF
	write calls in ncwa and ncra/ncea. 

	* Finally removed 1995--1996-era SGI enum workarounds from nc.h
	SGI compiler on dataproc seems to behave sanely now

	* Jim Rosinski and Stacy Walters have both pointed out that netCDF
	is not thread-safe. Therefore the OpenMP implementation is bound
	to fail until critical locks are added.

2000-09-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added OpenMP pragmas to ncea,ncra,ncrcat. They probably don't
	work either.

	* Multi-threaded version of ncwa averages variables in T42 file
	correctly sometimes, but also incorrectly. Currently unpredictable 
	what causes discrepancy.

	* Removed arg_cnt from ncwa.c. ncwa.c now uses standard
	fl_mk_lst() to diagnose incorrect argument counts

2000-09-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Got OpenMP compiling but not completely working on ncwa under IRIX

2000-09-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added full OpenMP directives to ncwa. If this works then ncra is next.

2000-09-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Contrary to the documentation, ncflint has always processed
	coordinate variables. Perhaps fixing coordinate variables is a 
	better idea? Patched var_lst_divide() to fix all non-record
	coordinate variable to ncflint. Not sure if I will release this
	though. Perhaps it should be a switch?

	* Improved ncflint documentation, including its ability to add files

2000-08-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed handling of netCDF convetions to search for
	"Conventions" attribute rather than "convention" attribute
	Not sure why I ever used "convention" in the first place!
	This should fix things like gasussian weights being subtracted

2000-08-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated var_dup(), var_free() to handle scl_fct.vp, add_fst.vp,
	srd. That's right, these routines were not handling srd pointer
	correctly.

2000-08-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Removed tally array from var_avg_reduce_max/min() routines

	* Added some clarifications to memory handling in the manual, and
	additional examples provoked by John Sheldon's GFDL netCDF
	website. 

	* Integrated ncvarid_or_die() and ncdimid_or_die() into ncrename

2000-08-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged nco-1_2_1

	* Will all previous changes to nco_malloc(), nco_realloc(), and
	memory management in general, make tst now seems to be well
	behaved with Electric Fence, and duplicates answers without
	Electric Fence. 

	* Another nco_realloc() tweak to satisfy Electric Fence:
	Now realloc() is never called when size == 0

2000-08-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Automatic type conversions for arithmetic now work in ncwa,
	ncea, ncra. Don't think ncflint would benefit from the capability.

2000-08-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed meaning and name of typ_prv to typ_dsk in var_sct

	* Moved target dat_cln from cln to dst_cln, opposite for lib_cln

	* Simplified internals of nco_opr_drv()

	* Fixed nco_realloc() so it does not call realloc() when ptr==NULL
	and size==0. Allowing a realloc() call in this situation is
	ANSI-legal but triggers Electric Fence.

2000-08-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Merged Makefile refinements by Ethan Davis to better support
	DODS compilations and less redundant building

2000-08-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Functionalized type conversion routines nco_cnv_var_dbl() and
	nco_cnv_dbl_var() 

	* Fixed x:y bug in opt arg of ncra.c introduced in 1.2

2000-08-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added this text to the license, provided by Steven G. Johnson 

	"As a special exception to the terms of the GPL, you are permitted 
	to link the NCO source code with the NetCDF and HDF libraries 
	and distribute the resulting executables under the terms of the GPL, 
	but in addition obeying the extra stipulations of the netCDF and 
	HDF library licenses."

	This is intended to allow NCO to link to the non-GPL licenses of
	netCDF and HDF and avoid the "KDE problem". Apparently binaries
	are considered derived works of any libraries they are statically
	linked to, i.e., netCDF and/or HDF. This means both licenses must
	be obeyed, but that is impossible because no license except the
	GPL is compatible with the GPL. So we the developers of NCO must
	explicitly grant permission to all users to redistribute NCO under
	both licenses.

2000-08-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged nco-1_2

	* Altered homepage

	* Added PDF version of manual

2000-07-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added mathematical definitions of all new operations to manual

	* Rearranged order of operations in ncwa so that non-linear
	operations may employ weighting correctly. Weighting is not
	well-defined for some operations (rmssdn) but I did my best.

2000-07-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Applied final min/max/ttl patch so min/max/ttl capabilities
	should now work as expected on ncwa,ncea,ncra

2000-07-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ncwa min/max/ttl patch

2000-07-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

        * Added section on Contributing/contributors to nco.texi
	
	* Fixed case when missing value is first in min and max operators

	* Added min, max, ttl cases to nco_tst.sh

	* Added temporary variable to all low-level arithmetic routines
	(e.g., var_add()) to store missing value in order to reduce
	dereferencing of pointers to missing values. This may result in
	measurable speedups for all arithmetic operators. 

2000-07-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Applied minmaxttl03 patch

2000-07-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added nco_op_typ to SGI enum section of nc.h

	* Update nco/doc/nco_src_frg.txt to include release instructions

	* Released nco-1.1.48.tar.gz on sourceforge

	* Switched all memory management to nco_malloc(), nco_realloc()

	* Implemented min/max/ttl patch (min and ttl not working yet)

2000-06-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Implemented Schweitzer's 'make DODS=Y' patch in Makefile
	Only works on Linux as configured but that's a start

	* Added ncvarid_or_die() to replace simple ncvarid() on calls
	where failure to find variable is an error and a dianostic of
	which variable is missing would be nice.

2000-06-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed ~/nc/nco paths to ~/nco

2000-06-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added explicity coercion to all lines which generated assignment
	errors under g++ C++ compiler. This might affect speed of
	conversions to long, short, char, and byte types from double and
	float types. These conversions are rare and considered unimportant
	so any performance penalty is acceptable.

	* Small changes to make code compile cleanly with g++ C++ compiler

	* Changed fl_mk_lcl() to try scp instead of rcp. scp should fall
	through to rcp is sshd is not running on remote machine.

	* Add Schweitzer's HTTP patch for DODS compatibility to
	fl_mk_lcl(). Will probably alter implementation in the future so
	fl_mk_lcl() works without netcdf library as before. NCO should now
	be DODS compliant when linked to DODS libraries. This allows
	reading, but not writing, of remote files using HTTP protocol.

	* Tagged nco1_1_49 as clean new version to start work from
	sourceforge without any overlaps with 1_1_48

	* Had to re-tag nco1_1_48 because sourceforge CVS repository was
	slightly out of sync with CGD repository

	* Moved CVS repository to sourceforge

2000-05-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_48

	* Found and fixed ncdiff bug in TODO #155. 
	Bug had been inserted in ncdiff 1.5 (nco-1.1.15, November 1998)
	when I switched from using dimension IDs to using dimension names
	to identify and compare dimensions in var_conform_dim(). Problem
	was that there are two locations in var_conform_dim() where this
	needed to be done and I only changed the first location. Then I
	turned off dimension remapping code in ncdiff which used to take
	care of the problem. Fortunately I had left that code commented
	out in ncdiff() so I was able to check that turning it back on
	solves the problem. Now I have removed old commented-out block
	from ncdiff (because it was confusing) and all logic is now local
	to var_conform_dim(). This fix increases the number of strstr() 
	comparisons of dimension names because names must now be compared
	twice in var_conform_dim() for each variable being expanded. 
	Oh well. 

2000-05-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed bug in -d dmn,,,srd case where lmt.end was incorrect

2000-05-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Finished testing of feature allowing skipping of initial files
	when lmt_typ = dim_idx. Seems to work. Now dim_idx and crd_val
	hyperslabs may have arbitrary numbers of superfluous files at 
	beginning and end. 

	* Added rec_skp_nsh member to lmt structure to support keeping
	track of records skipped in superfluous initial files for lmt_typ
	= dim_idx on multi-file operators

2000-05-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Altered behavior of single point hyperslabs so that single point
	hyperslabs in the record coordinate (i.e., -d time,1.0,1.0) may be
	treated differently than single point hyperslabs in other
	coordinates. Multifile operators will skip files if single point
	hyperslabs in record coordinate lays outside record coordinate
	range of file. For non-record coordinates (and for all operators
	besides ncra and ncrcat on record coordinates), single point
	hyperslabs will choose the closest value rather than skip the file
	(I believe). This should be verified.

	* Switched NCO from atof(), atol() to strtod(), strtol()

	* Added ability to skip superfluous trailing files to lmt_evl() 
	when limits are coordinate values. Needs testing but appears to
	work. Had to use a goto statement, icky. Fixes TODO #157?

2000-05-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* More fixes to fix problems with Electric Fence 

2000-04-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ncra ncea to RPM

2000-03-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added code to prevent malloc'ing 0 bytes because, although it
	is perfectly legal, Electric Fence complains

2000-03-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added target rpmnet to Makefile. Usage is
	sudo make NCO_VRS=1.1.46 rpmnet
	This downloads specified NCO version, builds RPMs from it, and
	uploads the RPMs back to NCO FTP site

2000-03-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added nco.spec to bld directory

	* Adding rpm target to Makefile

2000-01-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco-1_1_45

	* Fix to PID length bug in fl_out_open() on SGIs
	Now use dynamically allocated string to hold PID 
	Kudos to Juliana Rew for finding this bug
	
2000-01-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed all addresses except website to UCI ESS

	* Changed license to GNU GPL (!)

2000-01-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Calling ncwa without arguments now causes operator to print
	usage and exit successfully 

	* Print error message and hint when ncwa called with -a dim1 -a
	dim2 instead of -a dim1,dim2

2000-01-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.uci.edu>

	* ncks now puts string values inside double quotes, character
	values inside single quotes, other slight formatting changes too

1999-12-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_44

	* Documented record coordinate-stride capability for ncra, ncrcat
	in nco.texi examples and command-line usage routines

	* Added support for printing all character arrays as strings in ncks

1999-12-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_43

	* Merged all SGI builds (SGI5,SGI64,SGIMP64) into single makefile block

	* Added support for C-language escape sequences to ncatted
	Moved all this code from ncks to new sng_ascii_trn() function

1999-12-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_42

	* Fixed so that consecutive delimiter strings work,
	e.g., ncatted -O -a history,global,o,c,"hi,,,hi" in.nc

1999-12-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Fixed bug where ncatted neglected string values after first
	comma, e.g., would drop ", NCAR" from test attribute in
	ncatted -O -h -a test,global,o,c,"NREL, NCAR" in.nc
	because the new attribute value followed the comma delimiter used
	internally by ncatted to delimit list elements
	
	* Fixed so that setting strings to zero length with ncatted works,
	e.g., ncatted -O -a history,global,o,c,"" in.nc

	* Fixed attribute printing of lists in ncks: terminal delimiter is
	no longer appended

1999-11-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Fixed some problems with AIX build environment, switched to
	-DAIX on the IBM SP cluster environment

1999-10-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>
	
	* Defined MY_BLD_DIR in Makefile before it is used
	Re-tagged this as nco1_1_41
	
1999-10-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_41

	* Added dir to targets which do not rebuild *.d dependencies
	Doing this and installing latest make-3.78.1 fixes build on dataproc

1999-10-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_40

	* Added two more ncwa test cases to nco_tst.sh

	* Fixed another bug in ncwa reported by Keith Lindsay.
	The denominator in normalized averages did not always account for
	missing values in the variable being averaged. This bug may have
	been introduced sometime during ncwa rewrites around 19981201. 
	I'm sure it has not always been there.

1999-10-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_39

	* Added test target in bld/Makefile. Now `make test' automatically
	downloads a small (66 kb) file on which it performs a small
	battery of tests (bld/nco_tst.sh). 

	* Revamped build procedure to use GNU make dependencies rather
	than makdep perl script. 

	* All *.c files now build cleanly with gcc -Wall

	* Fixed Makefile bug where Fortran routines were compiled when
	they were not needed and visa versa

	* Moved NETCDF_INC and NETCDF_LIB out of architecture specific
	portions of Makefile

1999-08-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_38

	* ncwa now averages over all dimensions when none are specified
	with -a

	* Patched avg_reduce...() to fix set averages equal to zero when
	tally is zero. This fixes Keith's problem.

	* Added ncwa test #12 to nco_tst.sh. This tests for a bug
	reported by Keith Lindsay where ncwa averaged a variable which is
	completely missing_value to a value of 0.0 rather than
	missing_value. 

	* Removed C_ONLY token and made builds completely C-based by
	default. Introduced new token USE_FORTRAN_ARITHMETIC to build
	old style NCO with fortran arithmetic routines. Seems to work
	fine. Translated Fortran date routines newdate() and days2eom() to 
	C as part of this. 

1999-08-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_37

	* Implemented first attempt to use msrcp, seems to work

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_36

	* Improved patch to fl_mk_lcl() so it "does the right thing"
	when determining whether to try to rcp files

1999-08-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Patched fl_mk_lcl() to exit gracefully on filenames with
	multiple colons (which are legal in UNIX). Files with single
	colons in their names, as opposed to rcp requests, still cause
	core dumps and will continue to do so until I write a routine
	which determines whether to treat the filename as an rcp 
	request based on some sort of valid hostname recognition
	algorithm. 

1999-07-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_35

	* Changed WARNING message to print in ncra only when insufficient
	records have been found and last file has been processed

1999-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_34

	* Altered ncatted behavior to replace missing data values with new
	missing_value when missing_value attribute changes

1999-05-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_33

	* Using the new lmt_evl() dim_idx code for operators besides ncra
	and ncrcat, e.g. ncks, causes problems with wrapped and wrapped
	stride limits. One line fix to lmt_evl() restored old lmt_evl()
	dim_idx code to all operators except ncra and ncrcat. The new
	lmt_evl() code simply will not (and should not) handle wrapped
	coordinates for the record dimension in multi-file operators. 
	
1999-05-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_31

	* Fixed ncks problem caused by not initializing all boolean flags
	of lmt structures in lmt_prs(). Changed lim to lmt.

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_30

	* Tentatively fixed record hyperslab problems introduced in 1_1_29
	by extensively generalizing and rewriting lim_evl()

	* Clarified in User's Guide that default behavior of stride is
	that -d time,,,srd is syntactically equivalent to -d time,0,,srd

	* Realized new record dimension features of nco1_1_29 were buggy
	when min and max limits were not both user-specified because then
	total number of records cannot be not known a priori

1999-05-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as nco1_1_29

	* Cleaned up files for a clean compile with gcc -Wall

1999-05-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Toggled behavior of `ncks -a' so that default is now to
	alphabetize output

	* Fixed error (missing comma) in stride documentation in User's Guide

	* Implemented stride for the record dimension in ncra and ncrcat,
	e.g., ncra -d time,1,100,12 in1.nc in2.nc ... out.nc should now
	work correctly across files. Currently stride only works on the 
	record dimension of ncra and ncrcat, however, not the rest of
	the dimensions.

	* Implemented index-based hyperslabbing across files in the record
	dimension in the multi-file operators ncra and ncrcat, e.g., 
	ncra -d time,1,100 in1.nc in2.nc ... out.nc. The User's Guide said
	this feature had already been implemented, but that, apparently,
	was not true. The symptom was an "index out of range error" from
	netCDF. 

1999-04-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_28

	* Isolated build procedure in nco_dst.pl with --bld option, off by
	default

	* Added --dat_cnt to nco_dst.pl to support dataproc.ucar.edu

	* Added SGIMP64 architecture to Makefile to support
	dataproc.ucar.edu. Default netCDF lib is r4i4 rather than r4i8 as
	on winterpark so I am avoiding the whole issue by using C_ONLY
	defaults and spoofing SGI64. nco_tst.sh executed without errors.

1999-04-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@flagstaff.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_26

	* Fixed so arguments to log10() are reasonable

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_25

	* New version requires -lm for log() and ceil() functions
	Added -lm to Makefile for some architecture which were missing it
	
	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_24

	* Fixed bug where ncrcat and ncra omitted the last slice of the
	record dimension when -F (Fortran indexing) was user-specified AND
	user-specified hyperslab information was provided for some
	dimensions BUT not for the record dimension. This bug only
	affected ncrcat and ncra and only under these conditions. Thanks
	to John Sheldon <jps@server1.gfdl.gov> for pointing this out. 
	
1999-04-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_22

	* Added -a switch to ncks for alphabetizing the output list.
	Added index_alpha() and changed lst_heapsort() to accept an
	boolean switch argument to accomplish this.

1999-02-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added partial diagnostic message and workaround for TODO #116

1999-01-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added nco_dst.pl to distribution

	* Changed ALPHA makefile to support native compilers (untested)

	* Added NETCDF2_ONLY option to circumvent ncdiff nc_inq_vartype()
	call.

1999-01-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Moved index.shtml to NCO doc directory

Thu Jan 21 15:23:02 1999  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_20

	* Updated various portions of User's Guide

	* Added NETCDF2_ONLY token to eliminate nc_inq_libvers() call

1999-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@garcia.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bug in var_def() where wrong branch was executed when
	called by ncwa for files with no output dimensions. Symptom was a
	core dump or "ncvardef: ncid 4: Invalid dimension id or name"
	error. 

Wed Jan  6 17:55:26 1999  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_18

	* Added kludge to ncwa to workaround bug in var_conform_dim()
	where var_conform_dim() sometimes allows the returned weight 
	not to have same size tally array as the template variable. This
	caused core dumps in ncwa.

Fri Dec  4 15:06:23 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_16

	* Added new logic switch DO_CONFORM to var_conform_dim() to allow
	ncwa to tell when to mask variables. Reran test cases, everything
	seems to be working. Documentation seems up-to-date.

1998-12-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as nco1_1_15

	* Disabled ncwa -n and -W normalization options until I think of
	better way to implement them. -N option now causes ncwa not to
	divide by the denominator. Disabled -n and -W tests in nco_tst.sh
	(tests #2 and #3). 

1998-12-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Changed ncwa to default to weighting coordinates just like
	variables, i.e., toggle default value of -I switch

	* Added more exhaustive ncwa tests to nco_tst.sh

	* Rewrote ncwa section of User's Guide

1998-12-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Made sure ncwa weights were being masked when normalization was
	invoked. Formerly, they were not. This was a bug. The bug is now
	fixed. 

	* Rearranged normalization logic of ncwa

	* Removed special treatment of "gw" from ncwa

1998-11-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Allow hyperslab coordinate specification in exponential format
	even when decimal point is missing, e.g., "-d lon,36e1" is valid

	* var_conform_dim() now checks dimension names rather than IDs 

Mon Nov 23 17:29:02 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added -I switch to ncwa to enable weighting and masking of
	coordinates. Rewrote var_conform_dim() to allow mutually exclusive
	dimensions in ncwa.

1998-11-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added wrapped coordinate caveats to hyperslabe section of
	manual, and implemented warning message whenever wrapped
	coordinates are used.

Sat Oct 31 14:56:33 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as version nco1_1_10

1998-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bug in ncra which only occured when NC_CHAR and NC_BYTE
	types also had a record dimension. var_lst_divide() decided these
	should be fixed variables, thus the output file size included the
	record dimension. The timecom variable in LSM history files was
	triggering this bug. Solution was to make ncra, like ncrcat,
	simply process ALL record variable even NC_CHAR and NC_BYTE,
	though the averaging operation on these types is still
	ill-defined. 

Wed Aug 26 16:30:27 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bld/nco_tst.sh to work again at NCAR. `make test' now
	performs non-trivial tests of ncwa and ncdiff. Only works at
	NCAR (a necessary input file is rather large). 

Wed Aug 19 11:26:25 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bug where pvmgetarch returned "SGI" on UNICOS 10.0.0.

	* Improved Makefile fortran switches and added convenience
	housekeeping targets.

	* Fixed bug where cvs_vrs_prs() crashed with -kkv exports

1998-08-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added nco_vrs_prs() to parse NCO versions. NCO version is now
	always printed with -r option.

	* Fixed bug where -n NINTAP list did not recognize `.cdf'
	suffixes. 

Mon Aug 10 21:53:34 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Split ncks -m option into -m and -M so now global metadata can
	be avoided if desired.

	* Fixed bug in ncrename where fl_in could be free()'d before it
	was malloc()'d in fl_nm_prs(). 

	* Fixed bug in ncdiff where variables of same rank but different
	types would cause core dump when being subtracted. Improved
	diagnostics for failures with ncdiff. 
	
1998-07-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added -h option (suppresses history concatentation) to all
	operators. Changed existing ncks -h option to -m (for metadata). 

Sun Jun  7 17:45:20 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added more descriptive error diagnostics to ncvarid() calls 
	to var_lst_mk() ncks to report the names of user-specified
	variables which do not exist in input files. 

1998-05-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Improved nc_lib_vers_prn()

1998-05-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added improved error diagnostics to ncks when -A fails.
	Added improved error diagnostics to fl_out_close() and fl_mv(). 
	-r now prints library version for all operators.
	-r and usg_prn() now prints NCO homepage URL.

Wed Mar 11 11:16:39 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Removed warning message for processed text fields in ncecat.

Mon Mar  2 22:00:59 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added nc_inq_libvers() call to ncwa to diagnose SGI
	problems. This is the first netCDF 3.x call in NCO. There's no
	stopping the avalanche now, so user's must install netCDF3.x

Mon Feb  9 09:50:26 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Merged all three ncwa loops that access output and tally buffers
	so that these buffers can be allocated and deleted inside the main
	loop over variables. This reduces peak memory consumption by a
	factor of three and sustained memory by a factor of two to three.
	ncwa performance should be noticeably enhanced by this.	This
	problem affected, and this fix improves, only the ncwa operator. 
	
Sun Feb  8 21:50:32 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Downloaded and altered pvmgetarch from pvm3.4b6. This version
	was returning SGI instead of CRAY on Ouray (=Cray J90 Unicos
	10.0.0) because pvmgetarch thinks machines with /bin/4D are SGI. 
	Distributing this customized version of pvmgetarch with NCO.
	Also changed new pvmgetarch so it returns SUNMP on any Sun
	multiprocessor, regardless of whether PVM_SHMEM is set to ON.

Mon Jan 19 13:13:08 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added HTML keywords and section on large numbers of files to the
	NCO User's Guide.

	* Eliminated compiler warnings caused by type--format mismatches
	from all source code. Should now compile without warnings on SGI.

	* Removed -ansi switch from Linux CFLAGS in order to support
	glibc2. glibc2 considers resolv.h non ANSI so that using the -ansi
	swithc results in unresolved tokens in system #include files.

Tue Dec  2 21:35:19 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added fl_nm_nbr_max and fl_nm_nbr_min as optional arguments 4
	and 5, respectively, to the -n switch on the multi-file
	operators. This allows the NINTAP automatic filename generation
	feature to handle input sets of cyclic filenames whose suffixes
	grow to fl_nm_nbr_max and then wrap back to fl_nm_nbr_min.
	Now, e.g., DJF files may be specified with -n 3,2,1,12,1.

Fri Nov 14 14:20:23 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added additional diagnostics concerning record dimensions to
	ncra and ncrcat. ncra and ncrcat now exit when called to operate
	on files without record dimensions.

	* Made ncar_csm_date() more fault tolerant for files which do not
	adhere to de facto atmospheric model time conventions involving
	date, time, nbdate.

1997-11-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added error diagnostics for large malloc()'s in ncwa and var_dup
	in nc_utl.c. These should aid in identifying causes for core dumps
	when running with extremely large files or insufficient memory.

Fri Oct 17 12:53:54 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Deprecated checking for "gw" for NCAR CSM conformance and
	replaced it with comparing global attribute "convention"'s value
	to "NCAR-CSM". Fixed up ncar_csm_date accordingly and rewrote
	warning messages.

	* Improved usg_prn for ncatted.

1997-10-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed fl_out_open() to abort after receiving more than 10
	incorrect user responses. This fixes a bug where NCO would
	crash in non-interactive shells when the -O or -A options were
	omitted. 

1997-10-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Finished ncatted documentation. Cleaned up code to avoid
	compilation errors with SGI on memcpy(). Touched up manual.
	Releasing this as NCO Version 1.1.
	
Sun Sep 21 15:08:49 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Merged WIN32 modifications into distribution. Added WIN32 and
	C_ONLY 	tokens to code. Relinked with netCDF 3.3.1, had no
	problems. 

Tue Sep 16 23:53:44 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Wrote ncatted.

	* Fixed ncks to omit trailing commas after printing scalar
	attribute values.

Thu Aug 28 17:07:50 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@heinlein.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Rewrote ncdiff documention, which had many errors and
	omissions. 

Sat Jun 28 23:26:40 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bug in cpy_var_val_lim() in ncks.c which caused core dumps
	when hyperslabbing on multiple coordinates where at least one of
	the coordinates was wrapped.

Tue Jun 17 14:15:53 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@heinlein.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Changed Makefile compile rules for f90 on CRAY to explicitly
 	preprocess *.F files. This had stopped working, perhaps when I
	switched CRAY default from f77 to f90.

Fri May 30 13:12:25 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@heinlein.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Improved mss_val_get to allow any NC_TYPE for missing_value
	attribute. This was needed for ARM files which store missing_value
	as an NCCHAR. Converting NCCHAR to short, long, float, or double
	now uses strdod() instead of implicit type conversion.

	* Added routines to process time variables in ARM files.

	* Added hyam,hybm,hyai,hybi to list of variables which will not 
	be differenced by ncdiff.

	* ncdiff now chooses mss_val from either file where it's valid,
	and from fl_1 when it's valid in both. This fixed the last known
	bug in NCO.

Tue May 27 00:08:23 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Moved var_refresh() out of inner loop to file loop level in
	ncra.c. This should speed things up a little because var_refresh()
	can be an expensive call since it calls mss_val_get().

	* Altered mss_val_get to accomodate missing_value attributes whose
	type did not match their variable's type. Also made allowance for
	missing_value's of type NC_CHAR, as in ARM data files. Added three
	routines, arm_inq(), arm_time_mk(), and arm_time_install(), which
	implemente the ARM convention time=base_time+time_offset
	convention in ncrcat.

Fri May 16 16:28:02 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@heinlein.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed bug in srt vector in ncdiff. Now ncdiff should be working
	with hyperslabs.

Mon May  5 17:55:00 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@heinlein.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Implemented nclong fix for SGI64. This involved very slight
	changes: made defs.h:ptr_unn->lp point to nclong rather than long
	cast_void_nctype():ptr->lp evaluates to (nclong *).

Sun Mar 30 15:26:10 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* added and removed some return() statements to nc_utl.c to stop
	compiler warnings from SGI cc.

	* fixed small memory leak and bug in var_srt_zero() where var->srt
	was being allocated twice, and the xrf sct was pointing to the
	copy that had not been zeroed.

Thu Mar 27 15:13:18 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Removed ncap from target all in Makefile

	* Added section describing differences between ncra, ncea, ncrcat,
	and ncecat to nco.texi.

	* Fixed memory leak in ncecat in which memory never seemed
	to be deallocated until the end of the file loop.

Wed Mar 26 21:13:09 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added nco.ps, nco.dvi, nco.html, texi2html, texi2dvi to
	distribution

	* Changed ncks -s option to accept full printf() style format
	strings 

	* Fixed memory leak in var_get() in nc_utl.c which caused memory
	to be allocated twice. This also fixed longstanding performance
	problem where ncrcat() allocated memory for entire array not just
	current record. Thanks to jps@GFDL.GOV (John Sheldon) for
	discovering this bug.

	* General release of nco-0.9 on netCDF and CCM mailing lists 

Thu Feb  8 23:01:04 MST 1996  Charlie Zender  <zender@ncar.ucar.edu>

	* First internal CGD release of operator set known as ncz-0.9

Sat May 15 23:01:04 MST 1993  Charlie Zender  <zender@ncar.ucar.edu>

	* First RCS snapshot of ncks.c in directory nc.
	ncks.c began life as c_template.c
